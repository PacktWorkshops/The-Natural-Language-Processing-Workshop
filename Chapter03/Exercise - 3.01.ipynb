Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\\nout of \"perfectly rational grounds\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \"new\"?
