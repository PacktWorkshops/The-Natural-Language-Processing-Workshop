## About The Natural Language Processing Workshop
The [Natural Language Processing Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Workshop-understand/dp/1800208421/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1611057842&sr=8-1&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801077811&utm_term=Natural%20Language%20Processing&utm_content=The%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20Workshop) takes you through fundamental NLP techniques, such as preparing datasets, collecting text, extracting text, and sentiment analysis. As you progress, you’ll get to grips with creating your own chatbots and dynamic models.

## What you will learn
* Obtain, verify, clean and transform text data into a correct format for use 
* Use methods such as tokenization and stemming for text extraction 
* Develop a classifier to classify comments in Wikipedia articles 
* Collect data from open websites with the help of web scraping 
* Train a model to detect topics in a set of documents using topic modeling 
* Discover techniques to represent text as word and document vectors
