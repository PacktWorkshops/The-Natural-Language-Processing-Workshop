@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
"@united ""Airport snow removal method #22...""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU"
"@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
@united rude rude
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united 6533 ORD to DCA
"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
@united I will not be flying you again
"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."
"@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!"
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
"@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement."
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
"@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat."
@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
@united thx for update
@united thank you !
@united dm these nuts
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
"@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy."
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@united Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@united Thank you.
@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
"@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey"
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
@united please be good to me this weekend!
"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
@united yall should probably work on that.
"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united DM does not work what do I do?
@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago

"@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx"
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@united Done and done
"@united thanks, just sent :)"
"@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?"
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
"@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round"
"@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?"
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united thnx for the info
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united Okay thank you
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united you are one great airline ❤️
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
"@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL"
@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
“@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN” We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@united yes I do.
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
@united Deep Vein thrombosis
"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
“@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
@united DM sent
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united But thanks for asking
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
"@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly."
@united you too!
@united is my favorite airline.
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
@united why would they make me share a room?
"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
"@united i understand, thanks"
"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM

"@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?"
@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
@united I hope so too
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
@united where is my flight voucher?
"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
"@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes"
"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
@united thank you.

"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site—it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
“@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP” what's the point of membership?
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united Dmed you. Thank you
@united thanks we'll be in touch!
@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
"@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?"
@united like continental's chicken feat fairs
@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
Yes!! Thanks so much!!! 💜“@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY”
"@united captain ""on behalf of the front office, welcome on board."".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain"
@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
"@united to be clear on my luggage comment, I am referencing the photo attached. Flight 6232 to JAC http://t.co/PnBajfkmHG"
@united These are great fares!!!!!
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@United so what’s the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ✈️
@united So you are inadequate by accident?
@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
"@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now"
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ❄️❄️
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
@united Thank you!
@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
"@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home"
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on"
@united I did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
"@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.

@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @FlyHighAtlantic for me. #branson #FlyHighatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
@united I think DM would be better
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
@united done
"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
@united thank you
@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@united he has no priority and Iove it
@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley 😃😃😃
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
Thank you “@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH”
@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@united Ok thank again for your help!
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
"@united This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
@united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿
"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
But I don't see AA @united
@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
@united look at this beauty 😉 dc 10 united airlines 😉 http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
@united ok thx!
@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
@united go to hell
"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
@united Definitely will!
@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.

@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
"@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?"
@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X

"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united that's not even an apology
@united that's cool - now what?
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"
"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
"@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981"
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member 😔
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
"@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?"
"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
"@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"
@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
"@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.."
@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
"@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"
@united it won't help...been there done that.
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@united would love help getting there today. In #EWR now. Will take any airline and connections. Thx
@united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
@united 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap
@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@united thank you!
@united Thanks for the update.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? 😭
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
@united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @FlyHighAirways knows better..
@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
"@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?"
"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@united please see dm!!
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
@united still no response??
@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@united Thanks!
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
"@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!"
@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
"@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way"
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@united at the gate! IAD to RDU
"@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule..."

@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
"@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help"
"@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR."
@united love the new 1st class breakfast!
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
"@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!"
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@united Left item n the seatback on UA1260. Is there any way to call DCA to ask if they have the item? Already submitted lost &amp; found report
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@united I DM'd child's birthdate and full name.
@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
"@united I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.
J"
"@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place."
@united it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response
@united Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much.
"@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!"
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@united flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!!
@united two years old.  Birthdate 11/13/2012
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@united I already did.
"@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here."
"@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck."
"@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR"
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@united what would it cost
@united I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService

@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
"@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again."
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
"@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?"

@united please help http://t.co/t5mRj5Yw6I
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united hilarious
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
"@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm"
"@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee"
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
"@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!"
@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well
@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight
@united Was able to send the DM. All good now.

@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@united Thanks. Got it straightend out last night.
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
"@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback"
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
"@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?"
"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to you😊 http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
"@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again."
"@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet"
"@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH"
@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@united literally sucks
@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
"@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues"
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket

@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@united the child is two years old
@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail
@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?

@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
@united you are terrible.
@united  @DENAirport United 787 in snowy Denver. http://t.co/w1AaKJumXA
"@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight"
@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
@united … But friendly efficient air attendants in coach #UA992 http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR

@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united I wanna be grand staff
"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet"
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@united i need help but in spanish
"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
@united UA1469. Just landed.
@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
@united flight 435
"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
“@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z”
@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
@united thank you!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
@united your seats are god awful.
@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
@united i sure will
@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home 🙌🙌
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
@united I need help with a missing bag.
@united I was. But I have given up.
"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."
@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united thank you for following up!
@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
@United can you help me get from IAH to SFO earlier tonight?
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
@united no thanks
@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
"@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!"
@united false.
"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."
"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."
".@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"
"@united Good evening, UA. Can you assist with an issue via DM?"
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines

@united thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second I got to ATL. 🙅🙅🙅
@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
"@united been good 15yr ""friendly skies"" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm ""only Canadian"" and thus not good enough for military preboard"
@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots

“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.
".@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it."
@united Resolved. Over hour of work on  ground &amp; somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service.
@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
"@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle."
@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
".@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure

"@United​ has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status."
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
"@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem."
@united you guys are complete ass
@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?

@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
"@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"
@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
"@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?"
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@united ouch not fair
@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
@united I'll be calling tomorrow
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
"@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...✈️"
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
"@united Okay, just requested to follow."
"@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated"
@united make sure you take care of @LSUsoftball team &amp; @LSUQuinlanDuhon team. We are 16-0!!!!
"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
"@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
"@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst"
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
"@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????"
"@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !"
@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
"@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
"@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc"
"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
"@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol"
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
@united in fact he received my boarding pass
@united @Lmuschel he is traveling with me on a sep reservation number F3KxB8
“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
"@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?"
@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
"@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff"
"@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good."
@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎"
@united you guys are gay
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
"@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!"
"@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered"
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@united no thank you
"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡
"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
"@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks."
@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I

"@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed"
@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
"@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show"""
@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!
@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
"@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went."
@united tried that. Cannot figure out where to go to get it.
@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
@united Did you get your 757 Model?
@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
@united direct messages not going through please help
"@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures"
@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
"@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium."
@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
"@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai"
@united so what's the solution?
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
"@united we got it, thanks."
@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
"@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam"
@united severely under staffed at Iah.
@united amazing hospitality and helpfulness from Anthony Lastella. Great staff 👏👏👏✈️ def flying #united again.
@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
"@united just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united 👍"
@united what's the status of flight 1008 Bogotá-Houston?
@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?
"@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs"
@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
"@united it was very comfortable, now waiting for our luggage"
"@united getting ready to book a flight to San Juan. Was wondering, Does United waive baggage fees for military personnel. Thanks."
"@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming"
@united thank you
@united finally got through and they were very helpful. Appreciate it!
@united pls follow for DM
"@united ah, that would explain why crew didn't seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first."
@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
@united can you assign seats
“@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer
@united not my luggage
@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe

@united.  Pls hold UA2066 for 9 cnx pax frm UA6194.  All runners.  A 5 min hold will save 2 fam frm miscnx.  Pls. Twitter is watching.

@united THANK YOU!
@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
@united pls follow for DM.
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
"@united It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a @Delta flight instead. #winwin"
"@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together"
@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
@united can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed
@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
"@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of ""pilots haven't arrived yet"" announcements."
@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
@united same day flights
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
"@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!"
".@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO"
"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@united I6EP18
@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
"@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?"
@united DM'ed you
"@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back."
@united why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
@united Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it?
"@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?"
@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"

"@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here"
@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!

@united can you change DKYDE6 to 4583&gt;36 on 2/23 instead of 3636&gt;606&gt;36; original reservation was for 4404&gt;36 yesterday but was Cancelled Flightled.
"@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks"
@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
@united fuck you for not caring 😢
"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."
@united question. Are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in?
Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!

@united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll

@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
"@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks"
@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.

@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
"@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better."
@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
"@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day"
@united I am - thank you!
@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
"@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool."
@united sister &amp; BIL stuck in Detroit desperately need to be in Florida flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website &amp; customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
"@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?"
@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
@united I just sent to you.
"@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport ""customer service line"" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv"
"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
"@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp"
@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
"@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting."
@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
@united thank you for flying me out of the mess at IAD and out to San Diego. http://t.co/tlPBaupIk5

@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
@united flight #1 no luck on #standby
"@united Do you have plans for an iPad app?  The iPhone app is great, but on the  iPad you have to flip the iPad.  Is there a beta? Tks."
"@united I tried.   We were hung up on, twice. After speaking with someone, then put on hold for 45 minutes.  No resolution."
"@united I'm not sure it will have ""next time""..."
@united now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'
"@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO"
@united you a bish
@united Thanks!  Good to know.
@united okay. Thanks.
@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.

@united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited

"@united are you looking for European Flight attendants for Paris or Frankfurt?

Best, 

Fabrice"
@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
"@united since I have an international connection at 9am, I'm hoping for the same thing!"
@united need help. Never got tickets. Conf #ggqzqd
"@united some compensation (e.g. upgrade to higher class for my rescheduled flight to MUC today) will be appreciated, though ;)"
@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room
@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
"Sorry, @united. I accidentally popuLate Flightd with you instead of @USAirways. Can't wait 'til ""U"" are the only ""U"" in the sky. #NewAmericanStinks"
@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
@united I know that. Thanks for the standard reply.
@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzW
"@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports"
@united no my concerns were not addressed
@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
"@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks"
"@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA."
@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
@united you hung up on me again.
"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
@united where is our luggage
@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!
@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
@united Life goal: complete ✔️
@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? 🌴🌴 It's so cold here.
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
@united no apology? Cool.
"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @FlyHighAirways ftw"
@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD"
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
"@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
"@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable."
@united Phone
"@united Freakin"""
@united Pick
@united Suck
@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
@united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane
@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
@united YOU SUCK!
"@united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age..."
@united if I was rebooked do I have to pick up my luggage?
@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
@united just DM'd
@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
@united I am following - you need to follow me for DM?
@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?"
@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @United Global First Lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrF2d http://t.co/dTLGUQ1kAk
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm
"@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available"
@united I see several economy plus can you put us in those. We don't have to be seated together
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/7br5t5QCXk (via @ParachuteGuy)
@united I see you coming to get me and @AggieMensGolf in Hawaii! #12thMan http://t.co/G8DKa3Edhf
@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@united I have a question
@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
@united I see two flights with two seats in the morning can we get on those
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
"@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards"
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
@united Doesn't have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
@united please get me off this plane #UA57
@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
"@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
@united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@united U blow
@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@united you're terrible.
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@united and waiting
@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
@united is the worst
@united still waiting
"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
"@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?"
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
@united following
"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!
@united could really use your help getting our bags at IAD. We're headed to YOW but now going to YXU

"@united do u serve peanuts/nuts on yr flights yr policies r confusing contradictory advice Pls help #Anaphylaxis,will u ask those 2 refrain?"
@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
@united On flight 1220 right now...
@united Can you help me get a flight out tonight to Houston?Just don't want to be stuck here till Monday with all this bad weather moving in
@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.

@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
@united never again.
@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united sucks.
@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@united where's the crew for ua748?
@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"
@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
@united thanks
"@united hey, I missed my outbound flight - can I still use my return ticket?"

@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@united The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/N2fvElcYgz
@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
@united - any way to get a message to an international flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@united you have a culture issue
@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
"@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!"
"@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost"
@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
"@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?"
@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling internationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
@united meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if u wanted I would have booked it - u will get formal complaint
@united give me an email address and I'll send the actually screen shot to you.
@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
@united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
@united haven’t before and haven’t this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing
@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
"@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags"
"@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
@united no wheelchairs
"@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance"
@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
"@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations"
@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
"@united thanks, we did."
"@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me."
@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
"@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt"
"@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection"
"@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?"
@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
@united please don't take my membership away :(
"@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning."
"@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!"
@united !!!!! YAAYY!!! YAY PROM!!!! http://t.co/DXicoyioxF
@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
@united I JUST ASKED MY BOYFRIEND TO PROM OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER ON FLIGHT 494 HE SAID YES!!!! BEST DAY EVER!!! THANK U SO MUCH!!!!!!
"@united yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request”"
@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
So appreciated! @united
@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
@united No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!
@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
@united SATURDAY this morning Man dies from Ebola http://t.co/hXVVIS0VWw
@united Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.
"@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain"
@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.
@united the worst customer service in Denver.
"@united ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ"
@united So what's allowed or what's not allowed to be carried in my checked baggage?
@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
"@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
@united I need #United to be a better airline!!
@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
"@united I haven't booked yet, I'm asking before I book"
"@united Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!"
"@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
@united cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx
@united since UA 1226 ORD-EWR is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in First?
@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?

"@united we have developers flying down tmrw morn. w/45 min layover, there is an earlier flight to have 1.5hr layover, can move them up?"
@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
@united Home is Calgary can you get us there without the added expense of accommodations and meals.
@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
@united thank you for taking care of my mom and reFlight Booking Problems her flight in phl.

@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt
@United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have?

@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.

@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.

@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.

@united I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX @ 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight
@united  No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi.
Hey @united you've upgraded me on a 10 hour International flight. I forgive you :-) thank you!
"@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever"
"@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks."
"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
@united already missed connection... UA 495
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""
@united we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for #charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG

@united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
"@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?"
"@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone"
@united I was flying home for a 9:30am event tomorrow. You pushed back my flight. Now I have a $400 ticket that won't get me home in time.
@united They held the plane! Made it!!
@united - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!!
"@united ok, have sent u info via DM. I appreciate your help and consideration. 😊"

@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
"@united If you'd love to see more girls be inspired about becoming pilots, RT our free WOAW event March 2-8 at ABQ. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh"
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?
.@united I took a screenshot and emailed it to myself. Let's DM and figure this out.
@united She 👏 won't 👏 be 👏 at 👏 my 👏 wedding 👏. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?

@United Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help.
@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
"@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with ""issues""..."
@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
@united no still trying to get home.
@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
"@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?"
.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
"@united @SCVPools 
Please call me at 310-795-2210."
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow

@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return.
@united no u don't
"@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!"
"@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?"
"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."
@united you know what would be awesome? Providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. Especially those longer than 6 hours.
@united DM sent.  Thanks.
"@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service"

@united awesome thank you very much for the help
@united you need to follow me so I can dm you to give you the info
"@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary"
@united yea I saw that I'm moving to China and have 5-6 bags will pay whatever but wanted to make sure it was ok to bring that many
"@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!"
"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours"
@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job 👍.
@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
@United thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!!
"@united ""most likely"" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks."
@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
“@united: @leigh_emery We don't like to hear this. Is there anything we can help with? Thanks. ^EY” another empty offer for help.
@united I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
@united UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior.

@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
"@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice"
@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
@united what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego?
@United #767 taxing in at #ORD @fly2ohare @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/uPocMmuLUN
@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
@united I am going to a service desk now to see what the options are.
@united I miss the Continental days.
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"
"@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunburn away...here comes the cold!"
@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
"@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information."
"@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening"
@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
@united Bag was finally delivered and intact. Thanks for your assistance.
"@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar."
@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?
I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? @united
"@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos."
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
"@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!"
"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
@united you guys suck!
"@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot."
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
"@united Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise"
"@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember"
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airborne.
"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I’ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y’all every time!"
"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks"
@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
@united give her the recognition she deserves!
@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
"@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go"
"@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks"
"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
"Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks"
@united Thank You
"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
@united Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
"@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall"
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"
@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
"@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF"
"@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE"
@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
"@United flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She's 1 of the best!"
"@united Also, group 5 is total BS."
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
"@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?"
@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd."
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
“@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY” 👏👏
"@united worst AIRLINE 
BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN 
BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/"
"@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore."
@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
@united please tell me I'm going to make my connecting flight from O'hare to #STL #SouthBendINWhere 🙏 http://t.co/qGwK10dEwv
@united Lindsay and ??.  Darn.  Terrible memory on my part.  I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight.
"@united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight"
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
"@united OK, thanks for the clarification."
@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
@united delayed another hour
@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
"@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back."
@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
"@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo"
@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
"@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel."
@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
"@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week."
@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
"@united uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... https://t.co/yBv0xaowKv"
@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up!
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
"@united blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6UXwPaduGS"
".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
"@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what's up?"
@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
“@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU!  United Cares!
@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@united this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
"@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond"
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark"
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
"@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly"
@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
@united DM ed u the request num
"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"
"@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!"
"@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct?"
@united exactly
@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
"@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
@united mine is GJQX6J husband is A587CW (Can't DM for some reason.)
@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
"@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?"
"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
"@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day."
@united Followback so I can DM plz
@united MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united your customer service is crap.
@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
@united thanks
@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
@united anything yet JJ?
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
@united Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?
@United Airlines Is Changing Its MileagePlus Program: Winners And Losers http://t.co/F1yvAiO9ul http://t.co/vGlx6Ykwqg
@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
"Can I put sun in my carry on? RT “@united: @ant_kneee Right now 0 would be a heat wave, so enjoy the warmth! Can you bring some home? ^JJ”"
@united Thanks!
@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"
"@united it just goes round &amp; round, it's be going on for weeks,"
Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@united thanks for more timely updates.
@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
@united thanks. That means I have 30 minutes to make my international connection to HKG
@united @JedediahBila KP I am not traveling - we trying to cheer up Ms. Bila.
"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
"@united well played, ^LO."
@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united I'm in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I've booked through Swiss air
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@united found the flight on @airfarewatchdog
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒
@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
@united DM sent.
@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."
@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"
@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
"@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?"
"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
"“@united: @LRuns4Cupcakes Please DM details, we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^KP” @ClarkHoward #Another #Airlines #Issues"

@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
"@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!"
@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
"@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH"
@united thnx!
@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
@united just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
@united Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
"@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."
@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
"@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united"
"@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better."
@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
"@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board."
"@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours"
@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
"@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive"
"@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited"
"@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that ""sandwich."""

"@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip."
@united just sent - thank you!
@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
"@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation"
"@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?"
@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst
.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
"@united thanks, i made it."

@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
"@united I need a breakdown of what the ""international surcharge"" on my flights cover. Please help"
@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
@united flight #1051 on 2/23. Thx
@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....

"@united traveling from FRA thru IAD to MCO tomorrow, concerned abt IAD weather. Can't change until advisory issued? Any advice?"

@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
"@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate."
@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
@united Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
@united I need a customer service manager to contact me please
@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
"@united Will do, cheers"

@united thnx ^LO :-)
"@united yes. Houston Int'l, Bush."
@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
@united Will do! Thanks!
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@United to start 3xdaily @EmbraerSA #ERJ145 flights from #Chicago @fly2ohare to #Evansville on 4JUN #avgeek
"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)
@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm
"@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49"
@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
@united #FirstClass to #London on my way to #LondonFashionWeek #LFW15 👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧
@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
@united tremendous. What would you recommend?
@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
"@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce"
@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?

@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"
@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.
"Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals"

"Thank you United! “@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN”"
"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
"@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos"
@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! 😜
@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
@united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
"@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
"@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :("
@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
"@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines"
@united alright thank you. Much appreciated.
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
"@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis."
"@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful"

"@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!"
@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
@united round trip*
"@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet."
@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
"@united please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority!"
@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
@united thnx
@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
"@united thanks, that would be awesome."
"@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response"

"@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!"
@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
"@united I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?"
"@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?"
"@united €202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?"
@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
"@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."
@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
@united - Kids left a kindle fire HD 6 onboard UA1037 (ORD-SFO) today. Row 9ABC-DEF (we had the whole row amongst the 5 of us).  Help...
@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm
“@united: @BattierCCIpuppy We hope to see you on board soon and thanks for the tweet. ^EY” 👏👏
"@united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?"
"@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course"
"@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the ""soft landing"" policy of no more than 1 level?"
@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
"@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled"
"@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family"
@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
"@united thanks, keep up the good work"
@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was &lt;5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
@united any solutions?
@united what do you have in mind?
@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
"@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus"
"@united can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks"
@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
@united What happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare
@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞
@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
@united that would be great - 1k us651621
@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
@united it's freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR
@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
"@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?"
"@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match."
@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡
@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
"@united @HiltonWorldwide @Caravannyc @MaysvilleNYC 
Let's go! Join me on my first trip back to NYC…as a tourist: 
http://t.co/egaEjtRGLb"
@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
@united is z and d code airfare refundable?
"@united no, didn't notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt"
@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
@united Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks!
@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
"@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff"
@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
@united Leaving soon. Thanks!
@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
@united my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
@united sent DM's
@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@United line up @iah #IAH @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/dJHXvJT201
@united silence is very telling
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??
@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
"@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM"
@United Stars and Bars @iah #A320 @airlineguys @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/mWSoGUC33p
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
"@united Had wonderful, on time flights from OGG to MSN Lost RX eyeglasses (thick) in the Admiral Club in Chicago this morning. Found?"
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
“@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KP”. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5.
@united in Bogota with no wallet is no fun. :-(
@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
"@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT CORNY  as a… http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU"
@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
"@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont…"
@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
"@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
“@united: @SonyaSloanMD Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: http://t.co/2TrgEMteBZ ^KP” Done!
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@united happens every time in and out of Newark.
@united Can you transfer my bags too?
@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
"@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done."
@united we were able to get on the moon flight! Just got to our hotel in Puerto Rico! Thank you!

@united DM sent. Thanks so much for the strong customer service!!
@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
@united ok thanks. I sent you a DM too. You can disregard that.
@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel 🎉🎉🎉
@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
@united perfect! Thank you!
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
@united smiling? NOT!!
"@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!"
@united will I make it with the delay?
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
@united why do you bother surveying me!
@united  I'm on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list.  NudgeNudge I'm told there are four slots open. Save it for me.  Please.
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@united looking back - never heard from anyone - I had to call and frankly got standard SOP - still think about it today
@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it
@united I am on 1528 and my connecting flight is 909
@united Just got interrogated at the United Club Chicago. #UnitedAirlines #rude #PoorForm
@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
@united can I access Frankfurt arrival lounge when I'm flying global first class?
"@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service"
@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
@united I will thank you!
@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!

"@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!"
@united What delivery service do you use? I'd like to call them myself.
@united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They've apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call.
@United  my home for the next 8.5 hrs. 777 GFC! :) http://t.co/MKpoGNntYC
@united Thank you.
"@united @perfectomobile I have to admit that not only the app is good but have lots of useful func (such the ""live"" seat map). Congrats"

@united the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up

@united or did you mean 24-26?
@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!

@united Yes ! :D (Y) From @therealaviation on Instagram :)
@united @perfectomobile You really shouldn't use the word 'crashing.' Just sayin'.
@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
"@united need assistance to change flight to get to an ailing parent..
have flight leaving Tuesday need to change ASAP to sooner #custserv"
@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
@united you need to follow me I order for me to DM....
@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...

"@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers."
@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
"@united  Need to change flight from this Tuesday to sooner to attend to ailing parent in FL, Need help!! #custserv"
@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
@united I have already emailed but I didn't know if it was more expedient to contact you here. Please advise. Thanks.
"@united I got an email saying ""changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed"" but I didn't make any changes. Help?"
@united yes when I landed.
@united Joni did a great job on flight 5653 to LAX. Thanks for a great flight.
@united So far so good. Just stepped down in Denver. Next Stop Portland!
@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
@united #OrthoDoc on-call to in-flight! Glad to have been of service!
"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
@united flight attendant regains karma by giving big sweaty dad cold water. Guy was running &amp; carrying his daughter.  Last one onboard.
"@united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus"
@united @iamtedking http://t.co/UCZzP9YpHk click lounges tab. Need to be flying on supported S/A airline
@united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
@united I just want shout out a thank the pilots and staff on the Feb 13 flight from Newark to Boston at 4:40pm.  They were super helpful!
@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
"@united For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines."

"@united That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal."
@united have all 747-400s been updated with power outlets and seat-back TVs yet? Flying ORD to Tokyo-Narita on the 28th
"@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that"
@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United&gt;
@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
"@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened"
@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
"@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?"
@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
@united any news?
"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"
@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
@united I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
@united message sent. Thank you!
@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?

@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
@united I did not.  That's why I am VERY concerned.
@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@united Thanks JT
@united Trying to locate passenger that landed 2 hrs ago in @HeathrowAirport UA938. can you assist? Is flight still in customs? PLEASE help
@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
".@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now."
@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed

@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
@united Thank you!! 😊
@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
"@united I don't have a milage number. I can't sent my mail to you via DM, you're not following me. I follow you now, so you can sent me a DM"
@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
@united thx. Come hell or high water...
"@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting"

@united refund?
@united aisle please
@united thanks for the quick reply! I just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon
"@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho."

"@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?"

@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
"@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks."
@united next day
@united I filled out the form but I haven’t received any sort of email confirmation that it’s been received. Is that normal?

@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
"@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?"
@united OMG THANK U😻😻😻
@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)

"@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting..."

@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
@united will do. Thank you!
"@united Okay, thank you both."
"@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection"
"@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free."
@united done as requested.
@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
@united Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -&gt; IAD. Is there any way to check if upgrades are available?
@united hey I left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
"@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround"
@united followed &amp; DM'd.

@united thanks
"@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20)."
@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
"@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!"
@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier &amp; I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
@united that's of course in lax
@united ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open?
"@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation."

"@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
@united DCA-EWR Flight #4372
"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
"@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!"
@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
"@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!"
"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"
@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united thanks
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
"@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1"

"@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?"
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.

@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
"@united It was quite enjoyable. 😊 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕"
@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
"@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated."

"@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ"

@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?

@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"

@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
"@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???"

@united correct date is 2/11/15!
@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
"@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."
@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs

@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
"@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation."
@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
"@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to...."
@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
"“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
"@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?"
"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united"
@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
"@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed."
@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
"@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)"
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
"@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there."
@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
"@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466"
@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
"@united and btw, the @FlyHigh and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!"
@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"
@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?"
@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."
@united thank you!
@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
"@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found."
@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
"@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15"
@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
"@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice"
"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
"@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight."
@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"
@united my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee?
@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍
@united flight 5431
"@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience"
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united @ShulemStern @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help."
@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
"@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee."
@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
"@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?"
@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
"@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?"
"@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ"
@united Cancelled Flighting. bought a ticket for a friend but cant get the credit under my name

@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
@united trade show! Come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and @webbernaturals! $$ http://t.co/1L9sCWPhph

@united please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can’t get in touch with anyone locally. What to do?
@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
@united How much is baggage check for International flights?
@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
"@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way"
"@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs."
@united #sfo #ClearVision #TV4U @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Q9bYn9pCTf
"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"
@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
@united it's amazing really.
@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?
@united this is me and my partners first trip to #NYC I bought the tickets at the same time Please seat us next to each other ConF# ILC0HP
"@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn"
"@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US."
@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
"@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP"
@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.

@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
@united no worries Your customer service gets a bad wrap but just spoke w agent who saved me huge amounts of time &amp; apologized for yesterday
@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united

"@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!"
@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
"@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!"
"@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline."
@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is

@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
@united did not get names...Dallas flight and Chicago
"@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT."
@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
"@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would."
@united Club in Denver is dope 👌
"@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell."
@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
@united @annricord January 15th.
@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
@united sorry to hear outsourcing plan. Boise is best staff/cust service in the country. #boise

@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
"@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens...."

@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
"@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac."
@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and FlyHigh? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
@united how come I have no baggage updates.

@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
"@united unless it's on you guys, im good."

"@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!"
"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."
@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!

"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"

@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it."
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
"@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now."
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...

"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"

"@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag!"
@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
"@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that."
@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?"
"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…?"
@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@united 618 was flight out of Houston
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
"@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them."
"Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors “@united: We’re bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"""
@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
@united is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card?
@united how else would I know it was denied?
@united obviously
"@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited"
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
@united I sent an email describing my experience. Looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.
"@united be  ""Chicago's hometown airline"" care about your neighbors #SaveTheDiagonals #FlyQuiet #ORDNoise"
@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.
@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
@united how about changing RNO -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight morning or early afternoon?
@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
"@united I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?"
@united instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals
@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
"@united captain ""we apologize for the delay, the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side, see 5 open gates)"
@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
"@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst."
@United is it possible to upfare to P a segment where I have a GPU waitlisted?
"@United Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY"
@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
@united I Want a Plane dad
"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
"@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air."
@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
"@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!"
"@united What does ""Cabin Functionality"" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?"
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
"@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere"
"@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this."
@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
"@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was born in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson."
@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
"@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!"
@united ooh thanks!
"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
"@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now"
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"
@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@united can you not see the thread?
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?
@united thanks! :)
"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!👎👎
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
@united Classic
@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
@united Thanks!
"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united no thanks
"@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now."
"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
"@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300."
@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
@united JT thanks for your help I’ll complete the form once we are back home
"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
"@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)"
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
"@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com"
@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
@united for our birthdays my fiancé &amp; I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
@united I’m resending the confirmation code in a DM
@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
"@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?"
@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
@united worst service ever 😈
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡...
"@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday"
@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
"@united done just now, thanks."
@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
"@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number."
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united can you send me another confirmation email?
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
"@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant"
"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."
@united thank you! 😊
"@united take a lesson from @FlyHighAirways , they know how to treat customers!"
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@FlyHighAirways asks their customer what they want
@united customer service 👎
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
"@united Hi again, any updates here?"
@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
"@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)"
@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
@united you are really trying me today.
@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
@united was never given one
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@united who can tell me where they are?
"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
"@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam"
@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
"@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
"@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus."
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
"@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time"
@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
"@United just played the Most bizarre ""safety"" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl"
@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
"@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere
magazine with out flying?"
@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4
@United Is Changing Its #MileagePlus Program: Winners and Losers http://t.co/38OTLzAK5d #airline #travel #loyalty #rewards
@united Brandi Zabsonre in Denver deserves a raise for bringing delight into a terrible travel situation. big ups http://t.co/TK3aOpdtSQ
@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
"@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?"
"@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem"
Thx! Stand by! “@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH”
"@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through FlyHigh, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?"
"@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?"
@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
"@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!"
"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
@united I appreciate the follow up.
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
"@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +"
@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!

@united all day travel. #swag #ijustwanttosleep
@united Thank you for the new Club at O'Hare. Very comfortable. You made the difficult weather days proficient and enjoyable.
@united Filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15
@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
"@united Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Sg7IQqFVsO"
@united why am i mot getting my refund?
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
"@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE"
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
"@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"
@united how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? Traveling from newark to glasgow. Thank you :)
.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
"@united New Apple crâpe, amazing! Live from UA1207. Really nice crew too.  #AmericanAir has biscuits, UA needs them 2 http://t.co/gZ9GqDT7Jj"

"@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on"
@united i have items of sentimental value that I'm heartbroken are missing

@united still waiting for a reply
@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
"Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united"
@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
"@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow."
@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
"@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion"
"@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait"
@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook

@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed

@SouthwestAir thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out.
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@SouthwestAir opened online applications for Fall 2015 intern positions throughout the company.  Apply via https://t.co/GmL7ot3IMH
@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
@SouthwestAir thanks for the quick response. Should I call daily it wait the 5 days.
@SouthwestAir I knew I was correct! http://t.co/9eueYxAwcv

@SouthwestAir Travel agent Darrel here at Love Field hosting a paper airplane contest to entertain all the children was so awesome to see!
@SouthwestAir Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations
"@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa"
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp
@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
@SouthwestAir no fare giving out clues.  In route now.
@SouthwestAir telling my Fam in Vegas now. :)
@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
@SouthwestAir thank you!
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
@SouthwestAir Why do you have to be 18 😭
"@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury."
"@SouthwestAir What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!!"
@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
@SouthwestAir 3 hours and 80 degree difference. Yes please!!  MHT TO MCO @sadie4406 http://t.co/MRAW3qDw4D
"@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action."
@SouthwestAir still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y'all. On my way!
"@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?"
@SouthwestAir are 5 people there?
@SouthwestAir looks like Bellagio to me! Good luck people! See you at the show at Vinyl
"“@SouthwestAir: Congrats to these fans who are seeing #DestinationDragons in L.A.! SLC, you're next! http://t.co/YcCITaeP3S” Thanks again SW"
@SouthwestAir Can a pair of tickets waiting for me after my sports practice? I live here and definitely know where that is! @Imaginedragons

"@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today..."
"@SouthwestAir that was supposed to say ""boo"" not book. booo."
@SouthwestAir #Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the  Warm Weather
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
@SouthwestAir: grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month...
@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year return trip from NYC...#feltthelove
"@SouthwestAir is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it."
@SouthwestAir  I sent a email to customer relations and I will be calling tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
"@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding"
@SouthwestAir Is it possible to add companion to only the 2nd leg of a trip?
@SouthwestAir best airline 👌
@southwestair #netneutrality Nice to see you prioritize Internet traffic to your own streaming service over other web sites!
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@SouthwestAir  Northern California coast http://t.co/nm4VNNF8Kb

@SouthwestAir continues to prove to be the best airlines 💪
@SouthwestAir Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons

@SouthwestAir thanks!!
@SouthwestAir Awesome staff at the  check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays
@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?
@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
"@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????"
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
"@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel"
"@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans"
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
"@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already."
"@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?"
@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
"@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice."
"@SouthwestAir weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.."
@SouthwestAir Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero.  Got my husband back thru security to retrieve his cellphone in Austin. Terry (#85832) You Rock!
"@SouthwestAir Thanks, you guys are the best"
@SouthwestAir I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free.
@SouthwestAir if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas 😉
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@SouthwestAir could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place?
@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
"@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow."
@SouthwestAir A+ to the Safety Dos and Don'ts Announcer. Flight 651 from Midway (MDW) to Pittsburgh (PIT)!
@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
"@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?"
@SouthwestAir another great trip! LAX 823 - LAS 3075-  BNA. Thanks so much!!!
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
"@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable"
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
"@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy"
@SouthwestAir Got help from a nice lady on the phone in Georgia.  Thank you!
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
"@SouthwestAir understand the weather, these kids need to get home! Nice kids doing volunteer work from a RI high school, please help"
"@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol."
@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @FlyHighAirways doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyFlyHighforbusiness
@SouthwestAir Thanks. I did go through these motions shortly after my flight yesterday. I wonder how quickly flight attendants are notified.
@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
"@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to ""listen to the intercom better""."
@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
"@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards..."
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
"@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing"
@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.
@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
"@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?"
@SouthwestAir when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available
@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
"@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed."
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@SouthwestAir they arrived Late Flight but pilots got us to DIA on time. #impressive #outstanding #greatservice #allgood
@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
"@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?"
"@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail"
@SouthwestAir Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account?
@SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her.
"@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours."
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
@SouthwestAir Glad to know I'll be flying the luv airline tomorrow ;)
@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
@SouthwestAir I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
@SouthwestAir thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice!
"@SouthwestAir open seating is like an open marriage, there's so much love for strangers!"
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....

@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
"@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out."

"@SouthwestAir Just reading your boarding policy, we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10, is it possible to sit together?"
"@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night."
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
"@SouthwestAir It was never really ""lost"" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!"
"@SouthwestAir crew of WN3946 SAN-SFO was brilliant! Rita was hilarious. I know I've been down on you before, but this was a great flight"

@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
".@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service"

"@southwestair yeah, 7am flight tomorrow, going to add 60-90 min extra because of the roads / snow"
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice
@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
@SouthwestAir I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!?
@SouthwestAir may I have my Companion pass please.
"@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done"

@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
"@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?"

@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
@SouthwestAir especially if it's your mom! #IChangedYourDiaper
@SouthwestAir @MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment
"@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?"
@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!

@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons iD is my favorite band and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them! it would be life changing to see them!
"@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +"
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
"@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?"
"@SouthwestAir yes, thank you. Just sent DM."
@SouthwestAir when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won 😭🙏
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
"@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
@SouthwestAir Can you please follow so I can DM? Thx!
@SouthwestAir sent DM
@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.
@SouthwestAir Received awesome phone help from Jim today. Helped me switch around flights booked with points.
"@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP"
"@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
"@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???"
@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the #DestinationDragons @ImagineDragons show tomorrow in Utah at @VelourLive! I've been trying so hard.
@SouthwestAir i hope i can take my selfie stick on the plane today! #goingtovegas
@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
"@SouthwestAir it is working on a different device, though. Any help is appreciated."
@SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected.
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!
"@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI."
@SouthwestAir hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir your employees at BWI have been amazing!
@SouthwestAir thanks for responding.
@Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?!
"@SouthwestAir Hi! Winter Wx Advisory issued for STL. Snow &amp; Ice &amp; Cold, oh my! Will you issue a travel advisory for that?"
"@SouthwestAir If a travel advisory is posted for DEN, can I then make changes to my ticket? Anything I need to know before I call?"
@SouthwestAir luxury! Only 40 people on this flight. I'm going to get spoiled.
"@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue"
@SouthwestAir when are you releasing your flights for September? Just found out you fly direct lbb to las! So excited! #tripofalifetime
@SouthwestAir unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help!
@SouthwestAir Gracias... appreciate that!
@SouthwestAir was fantastic! That's the best flight service I've ever had.
@SouthwestAir would love to win tickets and take my son to Imagine Dragons in Provo Saturday night.  Crossed fingers. #DestinationDragons
"@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch."
"@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????"
@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?
"@SouthwestAir Flying with you in about 2 weeks, bringing blankets bc it's freezing!😜"
@SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ??
@SouthwestAir how about some sweet promo code to help me visit my family!!!.... Please!!!... Lol
"@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated"

@SouthwestAir Another delay. Wow
@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@SouthwestAir this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir Hi! I ❤️ your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU
@SouthwestAir Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!?
@SouthwestAir I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for??
@SouthwestAir do we get to pick which @Imaginedragons show? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou
"@SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe?"
@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min 😥 #fail
"@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic"
@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
@SouthwestAir would be cool if the best airlines company hooked me up with @Imaginedragons tickets for Vegas ;)
"@SouthwestAir appreciate the reply, hopefully those LAX agents get the memo. Cheers!"
@SouthwestAir Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked!
"@SouthwestAir I notice that there are separate buttons for ""guitar"" and actual ""music"" in this pic. Some bands should take note of this."
@SouthwestAir give me tickets to atlanta! I would do anything!  Anything 😆
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
@SouthwestAir Just realized my Luv Voucher expired today. :( Any chance of getting some luv with an extension? Please? #VeryLoyalCustomer
"@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple ""no"" would do; I just want to know. :)"
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@SouthwestAir a nice trip back home after a looong vaca 😊🌴 http://t.co/9TRvfnCedL
@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
@SouthwestAir It was the usually excellent SWA flight!
@SouthwestAir you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
"@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min...."
"@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice"
@SouthwestAir seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight.
@SouthwestAir Jason (108639) at Gate #3 in SAN made my afternoon!!! #southwestairlines #stellarservice #thanks!
@SouthwestAir thanks for adding straight flights from Columbus to Oakland!
@SouthwestAir  I look forward to those direct flights to California to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline
@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@southwestair I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
@SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk

"@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND"

"@SouthwestAir ok, gotcha! ✈️😃👍"
@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.

@SouthwestAir are there any flights from MSP to HRL in March? I'm looking at 3/19-3/23
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?

@SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?
@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
@southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
"@SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight."
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your time!
"@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns."
"@SouthwestAir In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address."
"@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero."
"@SouthwestAir By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time."
@SouthwestAir Finally got me home #BNASnow
"@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow."
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@SouthwestAir looking for cheap flight to vegas
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do
"@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation."
"@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage."
"@SouthwestAir took delivery of N8661A, a new Boeing 737-8H4 yesterday. http://t.co/5z9STyUQJ3 #DFW #DAL #airlines"
"@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!"
"@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight"
@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate

@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
"@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab"
"@SouthwestAir - total win!! Happy 7th bday on intercom, chocoLate Flight kisses, and a chance to hand out snacks.Thank you. http://t.co/NKloZcNtto"

@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
"@SouthwestAir thanks, got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though."
@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
"@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers"
"@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said ""unspecified error"" and to call SWA"
"@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position."
"@SouthwestAir is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got ""unspecified errors"""
@SouthwestAir @PaytonTaylor129 I love Southwest and Payton Taylor!
@SouthwestAir RDU flights expected to be ok this afternoon and tonight?
@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
@SouthwestAir they put me on the next flight available.. tomorrow morning :( Any idea if BNA will be open in the morning for my flight?
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir I absolutely will. Where can I send it?
@SouthwestAir no worries. You're doing the best u can. Already Cancelled Flighted my biz trip. Still $LUV you! -RR 1079871763
@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
@SouthwestAir Heard apology ~45 times in the &gt;60 mins I was on hold. Now flying from another airport at a different time but delayed AGAIN
@SouthwestAir Happily! But you need to follow me in order for me to DM you
@SouthwestAir I will.make sure to tell everyone I know about this all around horrible experience. I will also post it on my business page.
@SouthwestAir and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
@SouthwestAir no worries. We got thru eventually. I was just curious. Best of luck to you dealing with the weather!
"@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now."
"@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???"
"@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the ""no charge"" part."
@SouthwestAir can someone help me set up a callback today?
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@SouthwestAir there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold

@SouthwestAir I am following you now. I don't think I can DM until you follow me.

"@SouthwestAir can you follow me? Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't rebook online, been on hold for 2 hours.  Would love to DM flight info. Thank you."
@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
"@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!"

@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
"@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)"

@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
"@JetBlue absolutely, my girlfriend and I will be Flight Booking Problems our Mexico flights in the next day or two, will send a Tweet when it's done!"

"@JetBlue Indeed. I don't know what's going on in Pittsburgh that weekend, but, it's drawing a crowd via JetBlue!"
"@JetBlue I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today."
"@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right."
"@JetBlue good to know, thanks so much!"
@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner

@JetBlue Thanks.
@JetBlue Thank you for the quick response! I am trying to request abassinet for my son. it would be great if you can help me with my request
@JetBlue Gerne :)
"@JetBlue Hey friends! Stupid question - Can I split payment methods for a flight purchase? Example: 1/2 debit card, 1/2 BillMeLate Flightr? Thanks!"
"@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:""your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins"" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!"
"@JetBlue All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised."
@JetBlue expanding!  http://t.co/Kk6EixifP5  #Nantucket #Aviation
@JetBlue Mark T.  in Austin was great handling my bag issue.  #thanks
@JetBlue I believe you have to follow me so I can send you a message
@JetBlue I'll read this over a nice glass of wine right before I dig my heels into my next novel! Maybe travel is just what I need...
"@JetBlue @jeff_hofmann @DeniseJTaylor @LaurieAMeacham Good one! And indeed, it's JetBlue's finest day in history!"
@JetBlue I would like the actual email address so I can follow up. thank you.
@JetBlue ...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels?
"@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS."
@JetBlue sounds fun! How does that work?
@JetBlue thanks! Calling right now!
"@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site."
"@JetBlue I know there's no actual 'mile high' club, but surely there's something I can join ;-)"
@JetBlue hello! my husband bought us a trip last night &amp; just noticed my last name is misspelled! What can I do? Thanks!

@JetBlue Haha. Thanks. You guys are great. Unlike the @nyjets. ;-) #GoPatriots!
@jetblue thanks
@JetBlue it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. Need the upgrade receipt.
@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
@JetBlue Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter
@JetBlue what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks!
@JetBlue thank you!!
@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
"@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset"
@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
.@JetBlue That's what I planned on but Boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! If I had been expedited I would have made it.
@JetBlue I wish you all the best of luck :-) I'm enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. Thanks
@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
@JetBlue great to see the RedSox plane and your reminder you ❤️NY side by side at JFK #catsanddogslivingtogether http://t.co/KFUyYoKUFv
@JetBlue  would love to go to Hawaii to visit pearl harbor.
@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
"@JetBlue lol at your ""estimated departure time."" Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right."
"@JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening."
"@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. 😒"
@JetBlue How can I best track deals and special flight offers? I'm liking your international options...
@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@JetBlue 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert!
"@JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet."
@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
"@jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better"
"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
"@JetBlue no one yet but some, fl 8162"
@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
"@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them."
@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
"@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!"
@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
"Happy for SFO, but hopefully you'll add PDX soon “@JetBlue We added two new destinations (FLL and SFO) from Las Vegas in the last year!”"
"@JetBlue flight from JFK-SFO was pure awesomeness. Mint Class and Tim our attendant was the best! Other airlines, take notes!"
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
@JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.
@JetBlue wall separating in row 1. #safetyconcerns http://t.co/zTrDwV0N4l
@JetBlue last sleep in Cali... back to JFK tomorrow night.  Looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all :)
"@JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people."
"@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was ""There is nothing we can do"" idk if that's what you mean"
@JetBlue with the free wifi #impressive #FlyFi http://t.co/T1RYpzEBc8
"@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail."
@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
"@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay."
@JetBlue mint seats are AWESOME! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the US!!!
"@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!"
@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
"@JetBlue 2 words: ""staff training."" What a joke-"
@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
"@JetBlue sorry, should have specified I meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal"
@JetBlue any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement
"@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report"""
@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
"@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i"
Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
"@JetBlue ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please!"
@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
@JetBlue 👍. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
@JetBlue @zakkohane pretty sure he's saying Ricoh had great service down at BOS ;) #happytohelp
@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
"@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors."
@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
@JetBlue THANK YOU! I am your new big fan :)
@JetBlue I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you!
@JetBlue you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp; @FlyHighAtlantic is ranked higher! @FlyHighAtlantic here I come!
@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi???
@JetBlue such a bummer.  But I understand it's a business deal. Thanks for answering me!  Much less sad now.
@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
"@JetBlue pilot: ""Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane."" Thanks guy"
@JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
"@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136"
@JetBlue thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
@JetBlue thank you!
@JetBlue awesome
"@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?"
@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
"@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?"
@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
@JetBlue Love you guys😍😍😍 http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS
"@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
@JetBlue you're still the best
"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
"@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it 😃
"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
"@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification"
@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"
@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??
"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
“@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.” Me and JetBlue are #BFF 🙏
@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
"@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate"
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@JetBlue all day
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
"@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
@JetBlue I think I have it selected already ☺️
"@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."
@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
"@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?"
@JetBlue finally! Finally!
"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
"@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot"
@JetBlue flight 2008
@JetBlue Pittsburgh
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
"@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4

"@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!"
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?

@JetBlue What confirmation number?
@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?

@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey

@JetBlue you guys rock!
@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ☺👍👍
@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
"@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(
I look forward to that do much!"
"@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?"
@JetBlue of course I am!!✈️
@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
"@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip."
"@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ."
@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
"“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!” Thank you!"
@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
"@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
"@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"
@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
"@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy..."
"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."

"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.

@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
"@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped."
@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@JetBlue don't I always?
@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
"@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board"
"@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
"@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks"
"@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures"
@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
@JetBlue when will the system be up and running?
@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO
“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)” Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;)
@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
@JetBlue 795 to Austin
"@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!"
@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
"@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you"
@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
@JetBlue thanks for the info. Already doing it now before we board! Looking forward to the future upgrades! #JetBlue http://t.co/5Db9eSBNzG
@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
"@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous."
@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
@JetBlue I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
"@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU"
@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
"@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it"
@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
"@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass"
@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
@JetBlue flight16?
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
"@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!"

@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
@JetBlue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!
@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee

"@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!"
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.
"@JetBlue done, thank you!"

@JetBlue  I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight?
"@JetBlue  FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service"
@JetBlue how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed
@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?
@Jetblue I'm so sorry I cheated on you with @Delta @DeltaAssist. Please take me back. I wore protection.
@JetBlue my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can't confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int
@JetBlue okay thank you! I'll check with them again!

@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒
@JetBlue great flight on a brand new jet. Great seating. Beautiful plane. Big fan of this airline.

@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?

@JetBlue your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone
@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
@JetBlue Counting on your flight 989 to get to DC!
"@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start."
@JetBlue You guys need pillows on these rockers to really knock it out of the park ... just sayin ...
@JetBlue I sure hope you guys get me to DC to speak tomorrow! &amp; @JohnNosta &amp; @United: I'm winning here with @JetBlue
"@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything."
"@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything."
@JetBlue status of flight 684 from MCO to LGA tomorrow?
@jetblue what good with the inflight WiFi?
@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
"@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least."
@JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26
"@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel"
@JetBlue what's the status of flight 1272 diverted to RIC?  When will it depart back for LGA?
@JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
"@JetBlue It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours."
@JetBlue at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled

@JetBlue send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘
@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
@JetBlue good to hear. Thx for being responsive.
@JetBlue Yup. MCO. 82°!!
@JetBlue Hey! Check it out!! It's snowing in Boston. Who could have predicted such a thing?! http://t.co/ufyxXkIsa3
@JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70
"Cool thx! Only a couple more #PGAShow flights til I'm #Mosaic...can't wait. Will be easier to change flights when weathers bad

@JetBlue @drwinston001 I think we'll need a selfie as proof...
@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
"@JetBlue gorgeous day, hope the flight back tomorrow AM is just as pleasant! Thanks"
@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
@JetBlue no news here at the gate. What are my options?
@JetBlue it's okay...I'm actually a tea kinda guy anyway. Thanks!
@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
@JetBlue  no ... I am guessing I have to call someone
@JetBlue why 730 and not 645 as scheduled?
@JetBlue #1408 IAD to JFK still hasn't boarded. What's today's excuse and how am I gonna get to work?
@JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood

@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
@JetBlue Received an invitation to participate in e-rewards. Is this legit from JetBlue? Just double checking bc the site looked different.
@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
@JetBlue I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they're busy but this is crazy
@JetBlue I have the emails that they are on their way
@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
@JetBlue offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn't go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp.
@JetBlue right now completely pissed off
"@JetBlue I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat"
@JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
@JetBlue dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me!
@JetBlue now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
@JetBlue they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8

"@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves."
@JetBlue that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.

@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.

@USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then.
@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?
@USAirways is a DM possible if you aren't following me?
@USAirways Fortunately you have staff like Lynn S. and DeeDee who actually understand customer service and simply being NICE.
@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp; ripping up our tickets!
@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
@USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.
@USAirways we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations!
"@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!"
@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
@USAirways always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn't full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair
@USAirways shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up!
@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
@USAirways I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time.
@USAirways Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund
@USAirways will you be issuing a travel advisory for CLT for Thursday?  A significant snow storm is in the way Wednesday night.
@USAirways I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable.
@USAirways thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer
@USAirways Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp; a beverage. Easy cheesy
@USAirways I cant get anyone on the phone to help with award travel.Purchased extra miles and 10 minutes Late Flightr the miles needed was raised.
@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.
@USAirways I need help about a ticket. DM me
@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason.
@USAirways thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet 😊
@USAirways I have two tight connections in #Charlotte and #Frankfurt
"@USAirways Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr!"
@USAirways thank you! I will be calling you! #CheapOairChat

@USAirways Yes. Confirmation number and all.
@USAirways did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
"@USAirways getting sorted, thanks"
@USAirways Sadly I'm currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can.
@USAirways that is certainly not the impression she's under.
@USAirways standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days.
@USAirways thank you!!
"@USAirways If I know I left something on my last flight (as I literally had to run to make my connection), how can I retrieve it please?"
@USAirways Why can't I check in online for a flight tomorrow am?
@USAirways - been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS!
"@USAirways after being assured by the pleasant woman at gate B11 in Albany, NY that life's not perfect, I'd heard enough."
@USAirways How do I get a receipt for a change fee when I originally booked with miles?
"@USAirways: u didn't bother following up, we booked with @Delta.  @Delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats!"
@USAirways we even offered to fly in to another airport and they said they couldn't do that. No explanation why they can't.
@USAirways any travel advisory coming for the Carolinas?  Bad weather!
@USAirways There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I'm not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info?
@USAirways @AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround
@USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
@USAirways @AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far
"@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy"

@USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on.
@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.
@USAirways where is your email address? Its not on this page: http://t.co/5cwH1yfOow
@USAirways You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I'll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again.
@USAirways how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours?  Should I be super platinum diamond status
"@USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you."
@USAirways great job today from your team with a challenging weather delay on flight 1925 out of Charlotte. #travel #friendlyteam
"@USAirways ""Airport snow removal method #22...""

.@USAirways It was this saturday during all the snow in the DC area.  Excited the flight was not Cancelled Flightled but sad he went missing.
"@USAirways @AmericanAir I love you guys &amp; I'm gonna let you finish, but I've been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher."
"@USAirways And, the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail"
@USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found.
@USAirways  2 calls &amp; wasted 3 hrs on hold to change my coming divided awards weather reLate Flightd flight. Y'all disconnected me 2x. Please help.
@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag
"@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have ""planned better."""
@USAirways - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A
@USAirways thank you very much.
"@USAirways I left my personal stuff on US4551 from PHL-BOS about an hour ago. Went baggage, was told plane left to call 800#"
@USAirways - First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!!
@USAirways is there a phone number or email address to customer service?
"@USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight."
"@USAirways ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United"
@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
.@USAirways I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home.
@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
@USAirways thanks !!!
@USAirways so I can make a reservation
@USAirways I didn't make a reservation yet. It's about changing name on my dividend miles account
"@USAirways 167 minutes?  ""Im not trained in that"". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?"
"@USAirways if I qualify for free 1st checked bag, is that applied at checkin? Same for using companion tickets?"
@USAirways any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on
@USAirways trying to use chairman upgrade cert for flt 740 on 2/26/14 but being told not an option with 10 open seats? How? Thanks
@USAirways but I've been trying to call them since yesterday and I keep getting hung up on? Can you get me through to them??
@USAirways what's the charge for oversize? Not overweight
"@USAirways to my legal last name. So it's not technically a name change,
I just used the wrong name"
@USAirways an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it
@USAirways Hi! On my dividend miles account I accidentally listed my newly married name as opposed to my legal name. I am trying to book
@usairways Ok thank you…I call from Spain to US for seating assistance!
@USAirways can I check bags through to my final destination even though I bought separate tickets from IAD to PHL  and PHL to Israel?
@USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
@USAirways how much is it to check golf clubs on a flight. They might be oversized
@USAirways If I’m unable to use my departing flight can I still use the returning flight?
@usairways Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online?
"@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate."

"@USAirways Thank you, although we're using our miles from our card and Flight Booking Problems companion tickets which can only be booked over the phone."
@USAirways I made it- thx.
@USAirways still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match @Delta?
"@USAirways Is there a phone line to call into that isn't being affected by ""bad weather""? Trying to book a vacation, here... 👀"
@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly
@USAirways like they will call me? I'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering...
"@USAirways your CSR in PHL suck.   Flt 3883 gets cx'd,  i get rebooked to the next day?  On standby for 4011. Not hopeful."
@USAirways HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice
@USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone!
@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
@USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection.
"@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your ""go to"" maneuver?"
@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
"@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable."
@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
"@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to ""bad weather"" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?"
"@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says ""due to weather….call back Late Flightr""  #outofbusiness ?"
@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst

@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
"@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE."
@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
"@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!"
@USAirways How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation?
@USAirways can i please have someone call me 781 879 4505
@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir: 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks
@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
"@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate."
@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@USAirways what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581

@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
@USAirways I am a UK citizen. Is there a UK number I could try?
@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
@USAirways nope not yet...
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
"@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic"
@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
"@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job."
@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
@USAirways can't get back lost time
@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!
"@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1"
@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
"@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death."
"@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note."
@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open

@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
"@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I"
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
"@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo"
"@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold"
@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
"@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help."
@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
"@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens."
"BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! “@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.”"
@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"
@USAirways thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency

"@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account."

@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
"@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks."
"@USAirways yes, with Delta!"
@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
"@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable."
"@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!"
@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
"@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it."
@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak
@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
@USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :)
@USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today
@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
"@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers"
@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
"Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options."
@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
"@USAirways should, but didn’t."
@USAirways just now but no general announcement
@USAirways what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte?
@USAirways I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
@USAirways very embarrassing.
@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this?
@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.
@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
@USAirways @AmericanAir explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused
"@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight."
"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
@USAirways I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you.
"@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?"
@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
@USAirways  can you help me out?
@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
@usairways &amp; @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
@USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
"@USAirways while I’m asking… 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat."
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
.@USAirways Have you just given up?
.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute
@USAirways New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/WbhbljJkS7
@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
@USAirways can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please.
@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
"@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, &amp; picked ""Standby for 1st"" I was not put on the list?"
@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
"@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!"
@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
@USAirways ok thanks
@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @FlyHighAirways and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"
@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
"@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos."
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags

@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
@USAirways doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright

@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
"@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
@USAirways following you now
@USAirways sorry I didn't realize I wasn't following you
@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
@USAirways I made it! Thanks for the help!
@USAirways - Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
"@USAirways is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs , shoes, and golf balls, if that's the only piece of luggage you check?"

@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
"@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?"
"@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would."
@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
@USAirways too Late Flight.
@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?

@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
"@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. ""Look, over there to the left!"" Actual announcement."
@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
"@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)"
"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."

@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! 👍
"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
"@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight"

"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"
@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@USAirways how long for a reply
@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
"@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?"
@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
"@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077"
"@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever."
@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
"@USAirways great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE"
@USAirways thanks! Any idea when it will be resolved? I'd like to purchase my ticket!
"@USAirways Hi, can you attach my AA FF# 94LXA62 to reservation E2KVM4. Thansk!"
@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
@USAirways Your system is affected by the weather?
@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Hi guys! Are flights 5594 and 3937 still on time? The site and app are both down and I can't check. Thanks!

"@USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning."
@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost
@USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail

"@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced."
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
@USAirways Will you pick up your phone then?
@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
"@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times"
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
@USAirways FYI your customer service rep Carol is an absolute delight. So pleasant to with with and rebooked me in lightning speed! Thanks!

"@USAirways thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed."
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
"@USAirways I understand that, and when I'm attempting to change the information so they are identical, it tells me to call a #"
@USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update.

"@USAirways Cancelled Flights flight Tampa to Philadelphia today due to runway conditions yet tonnes of USAirways flights landing there today, explain!"
@USAirways your phone system is not working at all I have been bumped again so now I am at 3 times I need to get out of mco
@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash
@USAirways 4914 from PHL to BGM. I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks!
"@USAirways @AmericanAir ""ma'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure"" ""but I was here 20 mins before?!?"" laughter from the 2 agents"
"@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: ""why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?"""
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
"@USAirways @AmericanAir me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents"
@USAirways I need to speak with a live person. I've had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we'd have our luggage by yest.
@USAirways Thanks for the information!
@USAirways @AmericanAir I need to move a reservation due to weather in the middle part of the U.S.  I would like to change departing airport
@USAirways couldn't be more thankful to your #orf and #dca crews on the ground and in the air today for help with a sick kid and a lost bag!
@USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast
@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone help me with some travel issues today?
"@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable."
"@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply."
@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
"@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.."
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir what are your weight restrictions for carry on luggage? Can find measurements but not weight restrictions. TIA
@USAirways i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now....
@USAirways I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable
@USAirways Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - @americanairlnes finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM
@USAirways I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids
"@USAirways Will tweet all day until I get 
a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health."
@USAirways Thank you.
@USAirways 4473.  She just called to say it's a runway clearing problem of all things.
@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
@USAirways @AmericanAir on hold for 8 hours yesterday w/o speaking to an agent on hold again w/ 2 phones ~30 mins let the bashing begin...
@USAirways will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today?
@USAirways can you add my KTN to an existing reservation?
@USAirways please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!!
@USAirways I will. Is it down or is just me?
@USAirways I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary?
@USAirways Your CLT baggage crew deserves a #kudos. I had to run to make my connection. And my bags still made it! #CustomerService
@USAirways Thanks!
@USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight
"@USAirways: I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience."
@USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me.
"@USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; ""Anthony"" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down."
"@USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to ""ground handling delays affecting a prior flight."""

@USAirways : We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways thank you for the apology
@USAirways Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn't help.  The website won't let me submit a reply.
@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
“@USAirways: @hegshmeg O” thank you for that elaborate response
@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
@USAirways Is your refund system down?
@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
"That's not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t"
@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
"@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline"
"@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy"
@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
"@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help"
@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
"@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise"
@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
"@USAirways. wow, awful customer service."
@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏
@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you.
"@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking."
@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
"@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again."
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒
@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
"@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience"
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"
"@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area."
@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
"@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!"
"@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat...."
@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled."
@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
@USAirways the call hung up on me..
@USAirways got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! http://t.co/5cDX2ROAE6
@USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL
Number or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways
@USAirways Thank you. I'll do that next time!
@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡
@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg

@USAirways looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks!
@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
@USAirways you are the worst.

@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it
@USAirways and @AmericanAir aren't as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe. Maybe @Delta or @united can get me home?
"@USAirways absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!!"
"@USAirways @AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected"

@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
"@USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no..."
@USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours.
"@USAirways @AmericanAir have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees. Stay tuned."
"@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?"

@USAirways This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am?
@USAirways Have you issued a Memphis travel advisory for tomorrow? Winter weather coming through now.
@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.
"@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly"
@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
"@USAirways - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards"

@USairways Since I am a loyal USAir customer I am sure that they will make this up to me-right now I want to get home &amp; back to work.
@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
@USAirways you're really fudgin up with all these delays 😡 #justwantmybed
"@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work."

"@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure"
@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.

@USAirways I packed a carry on for a reason. Thanks for making me check it. I hoped for better customer service in CLE also. #nothappy
@usairways sadly they've tried that and airport agents…no flights so they're stranded at PHL. No chance of a hotel for them?

"@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city"

@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
"@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail."

@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.

@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
"@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25."
@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
"@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights"
@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."
"@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime"
@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
"@USAirways ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill"
@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
"@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief."
"@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem."
@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!

@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
"@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?"
"@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks"

@USAirways I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now?
@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to
@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
"@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales"

@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.

@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.

@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"
"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("

@USAirways Yes thank you. Appreciate u checking...
@USAirways why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website?
@USAirways this is ridiculous #planebroken can't wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab
"@USAirways Yes, it was Sunday."
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
"@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing."
"@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable."
@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.
@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?
@USAirways can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?  I will have a tight connection out of clt to mco.
@USAirways Please hold US1765 for me. Need to get home tonight before weather. Almost there.
@USAirways followed!
@USAirways Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her
@USAirways have scheduled flight Sat(2morrow) CHO-CLT CHO needs to be added to weather advisory.  Please evaluate asap.
@USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel
@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
"@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail"
@USAirways will shall see in the next couple of minutes.
"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm."
"@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer."
@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.
"@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!"
"@USAirways sure, just DM'ed you."
"@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail"
"@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed"
@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
"@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?"
@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.
@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
"@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed."
@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@USAirways it's vegas baby who doesn't have a good time in vegas lol
@USAirways me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn't get any out of tricities here in Tn
"@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's ""not worth it"" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS"
"@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this ""service"" is acceptable. #customerservicefail"
"“@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.” #false"
@USAirways absolutely
@USAirways It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has
@USAirways we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right?
@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
"@USAirways Welcome to North Texas US Air / American Air employees. 
Housing and Education are great opportunities in The GR8 State Of Texas"
@USAirways oh they saw it and said nothing.
@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
"@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?"
@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.
@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
@USAirways can I bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight?
@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
@USAirways Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly.
@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
"@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!"
@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
"@USAirways awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is!"
@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days
@USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up
@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
"@USAirways Literally all that says is ""Case open""  What good is that to me?"
@USAirways no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights
@USAirways Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
"@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect"
@USAirways Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional!
"@USAirways 
Good news, we got fixed."
@sarahpompei don't bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice
@USAirways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online
@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
"@USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines."
@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
@USAirways thank you!
"@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!"
"@USAirways Yes, I get that. I’m asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I’ve given you?"
@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
"@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA"
@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS!
"@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed"
"@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA."
"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
@USAirways Thank you
@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
"@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps."
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
"@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?"
@USAirways Thank you. But I don’t understand. What will you do with my feedback?
"@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!"
@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
"@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL"
@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
"@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed."
@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
@USAirways Done
@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."""
"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"
@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
@USAirways what is the damn delay????
@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ⛄️☀️
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"

"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
@USAirways I am following you now
@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
"“@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!!"
@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
@USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help!"
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
"@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
"@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!"
@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
"@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE."
@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
"@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost"
"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
"@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ"
@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight

"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)"
@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
"@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?"
@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"
@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
"@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?"
@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning.
"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡
"@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates"
@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
"@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,"
@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
"@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival"
"@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more"
"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."
@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
"“@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt"
@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
@USAirways lol me too
@USAirways still waiting on a response
@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
@USAirways How will I change it?
@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
"@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?"
"@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!"
@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"
"@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad."
@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
"@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft."
"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
"@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way."
@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day
@USAirways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
"@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?"
@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO 😂😂😂😂
@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
@USAirways can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight?
@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!

@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
"@AlbertBreer just so you know who to complain to ;-) RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from @AmericanAir."
@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
"@USAirways @AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!!"
"@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery"
"@USAirways I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn"
@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
@USAirways is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP
@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful

@USAirways that's where we are now. Thank you.
"@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?"
@USAirways flight was full.  1 open middle seat.  Did not want to sit there.  What is your policy?
@USAirways 657. My daughter Candice and I are together with her baby.
"@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?"
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
@USAirways #tbt every day.
@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
"@USAirways if you've got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero!"
@USAirways @CakeNDeath Question is will he and his lady behave...
"@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some ""white revive"" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single."
@USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours

@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
@USAirways what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication!
@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.

@USAirways 😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
@USAirways thank you
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.

@USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue?
"@USAirways My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled ""do no occupy"" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable"
@USAirways phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it!
@USAirways KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff!
@USAirways let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less!

"@USAirways btw, not upset at usaiways, promise."
@USAirways i hate you
"@USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable"
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
"@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy"
@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
"@USAirways the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land."
"@USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!"
@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?
@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA
@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
"@USAirways if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now"
@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service

"@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV"

@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
"@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags"

@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it

@USAirways will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit?
@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
@USAirways I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging?
@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
"@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back"

@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her
@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
"@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!"

@USAirways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
@USAirways delays to the max
@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
"@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected."
@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
"@USAirways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change"
"@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?"
@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers

@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
"@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where..."
@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
“@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code?

"@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :("
@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
"@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks"
@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
"@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good"
@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.

"@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v"
"@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided."
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
@USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready
"@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic"
"@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate"
@USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!
@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far

@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.

@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
"@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!"
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
"@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off."
@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
"@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher"
"@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer."
@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
@USAirways that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
"@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks"
@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
"@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain"
"@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone."
@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
"@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened"""

@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks

@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
"@USAirways Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?"
"@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase."
@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
"@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?"
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
"@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again"
@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
"@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!"
"@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks."
@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
"@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options"
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
"@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?"
@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
"@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us..."
@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
@USAirways your agent did not say
"@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho"
@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
"@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request"
@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
"@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information."
"@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up"

@USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting
@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
@USAirways link doesn't work and I've tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn't clarify where it is.
@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
@USAirways Thank you!!! On our way to get her bag now - thanks to having that number 😊
@USAirways how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ?
@USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
@USAirways this is crazy. Haven't spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD
@usairways can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL.
"@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!"
@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
"@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies."
@USAirways where's my apology?
@USAirways Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn't talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg.
"@USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help?"
"@USAirways new tag line ""but we got you there alive!"""

"@USAirways announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate, but it was a 'direct flight' #logic"

"@USAirways Thank you, busy times."
"@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a ""sorry for your inconvenience"" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed"

"@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!"
@usairways traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover.
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@USAirways of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I'll choose wiser next time
"@USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue."
@USAirways half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming
@USAirways on the phone now. looks like global
"@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number."
"@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers."
@USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again
"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
@USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact?
"@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5"
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 👿
@USAirways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
"@USAirways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home 👠👠👠 (3 heel clicks)"
"@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?"
@USAirways Shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from DCA to CHS at 7:10 tonight. Didn't get her name but she was great!
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
"@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour"
@USAirways Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight
@USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
"@USAirways Awesome USAir, TYSVM &lt;3"
@USAirways Thank you!
@USAirways  that would be lovely! You have great people working in your organization.
@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.
@USAirways hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board
@USAirways me too. Me too.
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑
"@USAirways TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ &lt;3"
@USAirways thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO
@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
@USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
@USAirways  glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn't get back bc of scheduling problems.
"@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA"

@USAirways @erickofiejones how long are billing cycles
@USAirways on hold for 1:23. All because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA
@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
"@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours..."
@USAirways I've been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain
"@USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all"
@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways
@usairways Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it.
@USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice
"@USAirways car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications"
@USAirways I'm amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers.
"@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less"
"@USAirways beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English)."
@USAirways they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy.
@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
"@USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever."
"@USAirways what does ""your reservation is 'out of sync.'"" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up"
@USAirways sits on a throne of lies
"@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!"
@USAirways flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do?
"@USAirways I'm on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight."
@USAirways I just hope that pilot had a good day off
@USAirways thanks for your help! I left a message for DCA lost and found. Fingers crossed we find it!
@USAirways is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today.
@USAirways Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I've ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee
"@USAirways Eh, it happens. I think I'll survive. 😉 Thanks!"
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
"@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?"
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
"@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game."
@USAirways and if the flight is full?
@USAirways been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down.
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.

@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@USAirways I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune
@USAirways Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable.

@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
"@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes."
@USAirways Thanks. It would be better from the gate agent at C14 in Charlotte boarding flight 1791.
@USAirways flt 5302 CLT to DAY supposed to depart 5:51; the 6:20...still no crew. #schedule/contact the pilot!
"@USAirways so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps ""i dont have ice on this cart"" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead."
@USAirways thanks
@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!
@USAirways 2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  @AmericanAir paid far too much for you.

@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
@USAirways that's why u guys are my #1 choice.
@USAirways thanks. 😒
@usairways I’m cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
"@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!"
@USAirways how about a drink voucher for the next flight?? #winkwink
@USAirways nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day!
"@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse."

@USAirways @Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks
@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
@USAirways done
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
"@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?"

@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday
@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify
@USAirways No kidding. Oy.
@USAirways thanks
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
@USAirways and it still says it's on time on your website btw
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
@USAirways no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot.
"@USAirways on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2)"
@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
@USAirways please give Tara G a pat on the back and praise.  She was very very helpful.  She is at PHL member lounge
@USAirways  thanks I hope I get to my destination
@USAirways  well its 11:45am and just got an email that my 11am flight is delayed-thats not right
@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.
@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
@USAirways @AmericanAir you make Spirit look like the gem of air travel. You haven't handle this winter storm very well...
"@USAirways thanks for the reply, hoping everything is cleared up in Charlotte by Monday"
@USAirways it takes a month?
"Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways"
@USAirways it was supposed to be a carry on and in Pittsburgh  coming to Boston it was a carry on
@USAirways You need to contact me ASAP. #Furious
@USAirways can't even get on hold to wait to speak to someone-awesome
"@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable."
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
"@USAirways I’ve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?"
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
@USAirways your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad
"@USAirways we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier?"
@USAirways I have been on hold with your Gold reservations line for OVER 3 HOURS now. Flight Cancelled Flightled. Trying to rebook.
.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh 😕
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
@USAirways how's us 1797 looking today?
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
"@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal"
"@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible."
"@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM."
"@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today."
"@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers"
@AmericanAir Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW

"@AmericanAir is the new 9:45 time confirmed or it may get Cancelled Flightled? Traveling with kids, need to be certain. Thx"
@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
"@AmericanAir DM the locator code, thanks."
@AmericanAir thank you!
"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest"
@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
"@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked."
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?

@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir thx for responding. I cant watch 2 mins of this film w/out it cutting in and out 4 prolonged prds of time. beyond frustrating
@AmericanAir I did

@AmericanAir r u serious?? 304min #delay with #AmericanAirlines #AA2444 #ohio - #dallas missed my connecting flight http://t.co/DNMsblzumr
"@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous."
@AmericanAir I might look into that. My wife travels much more than I do. Could we both use the membership?
"@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!"
@AmericanAir What happens when you combine Top Chef &amp; the beauty of San Miguel de Allende. My Late Flightst food blog.  http://t.co/7t1rDRCRe6
"@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed."
@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
@AmericanAir u r horrible.went online to Cancelled Flight flight-no button-4that.Called CS &amp;wait time 40 mins&amp;put in my #.800#called&amp;it hungupNOHELP
"@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?"
"@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah."
@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol 😃
@AmericanAir still waiting for a flight... I should get my money back
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don’t need this much trouble.
"“@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?” SMA"
"@AmericanAir Hi, can you please ticket my award ticket? The status is ""On Request"" now. Thanks."
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
"@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!"
@AmericanAir Trying desperately to get my boyfriend booked on the same US Airways flight as myself for the same price. Can you help?
"@AmericanAir yes yes yes,so glad to be headed home!"
@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
@AmericanAir thanks!!

@AmericanAir thanks so much!
"@AmericanAir @RobertDwyer AA doesnt charge any fees to change award tickets as long as the origin, destination &amp; award type remains the same"
@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
"@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of ""Whiplash"" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback"
@AmericanAir OK I will call them likely tmrw UK time to question the process getting the change charge reversed due to a bereavement
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@AmericanAir “Inconvenient” is such a convenient word.
"@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag."
"@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful"
"@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this."
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@AmericanAir Here is the photo ;) http://t.co/VMqUURZUpW
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 1357 out of sju?
"@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't."
"@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered ""perks"" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, ""NO."" #thenewamerican"
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
"@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
"@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again."
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
"@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA."
"@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned."
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie 😄
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
"@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!"
"@AmericanAir ""Airport snow removal method #22...""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN"
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
"@AmericanAir great, thanks!"
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
"@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice"
"@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! 😁
"@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier"
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
"@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx"
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
"“@AmericanAir: We hope you enjoy the #WinterWeather and brought your warm coat and gloves, Maria!” Yup! New beanie http://t.co/AnEqXZR4bp"
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
"@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response."
@AmericanAir Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
"@AmericanAir Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW..."
@DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help!
@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me

It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA."
"@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned."
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie 😄
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
"@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!"
"@AmericanAir ""Airport snow removal method #22...""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN"
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
"@AmericanAir great, thanks!"
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
"@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice"
"@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! 😁
"@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier"
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
"@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx"
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!

@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
@AmericanAir Fuck you.
"@AmericanAir 
Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it's return, please????????"
@AmericanAir I bet they do! I'm sure they have some form of wear and tear on their skin. I hope they will survive the rest of the winter xxx
@AmericanAir @dfwairport me too!!  LOVE LIVING SO CLOSE SO I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT VIEWS!
@AmericanAir Thanks!
@americanair Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend
"@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase"
"@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
"@AmericanAir @dfwairport Guys, let it go. http://t.co/vOxcghciJi"
@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
@AmericanAir I can hardly believe it! Bundle up and stay warm! 😉
@AmericanAir You're right. Someone is up to something...
@AmericanAir the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444
@AmericanAir Thanks for sharing these photos! Round of applause for your crews! We appreciate all their hard work.

@AmericanAir hook me up with a free trip to Barbados and I will tell you the secret beaches to see
"@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out."
@AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
@AmericanAir Thank you for responding so quickly to my tweets I do appreciate that.
@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir please email me at temorris2010@hotmail.com. willing to discuss my experience &amp; give another try would like to speak directly
"@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after"
@AmericanAir since you don't care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept
@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
“@AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/tY9C0Gae2o” Lol
"@AmericanAir 
I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?"
@AmericanAir if I could fly an md80/dc10 I would be so happy I live that plane so much md80 is love md80 is life.
@ods1819 aren't you glad this isn't you RT @AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/HEpkNpuzwU

@AmericanAir I'm sure all these birds will be in warmer weather soon.
"@AmericanAir It's been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks"
@AmericanAir This is very true. Another reason why we stay South in the Winter months of travel http://t.co/fgJbex480D
"@AmericanAir Would have had to fly real far south, huh? #WinterWeather #Brrr"
@AmericanAir um. down south has snow too #ATL
@AmericanAir I'm sure they did. It's certainly chilly back East today! 😮
@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
"@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!"
@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
@AmericanAir do you still use DC9's?
Happy #TT to my friends @AmericanAir . Hope the weather isn't causing you too many headaches.
"@AmericanAir if I've booked an AA award on USAir metal, and space opens up on AA metal, can I change to the AA flight without fees?"

@AmericanAir Are you expecting delays/Cancelled Flightlations at Dallas on 25/26th due to the snow? Nothing like Monday I hope!
"@AmericanAir just look at RDU airport. please think about the safety of your passengers. we cant get to RDU safely!

http://t.co/wDyEkVB1Ze"
@AmericanAir Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight?
@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska 😒
@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
@AmericanAir I need refund.
"@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS"
@AmericanAir why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory???
@AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
@AmericanAir have your experts seen this? this is right at RDU airport. http://t.co/mPliO6DYgn
"@AmericanAir stop sending me back to ""customer relations ""I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!"

Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks"
@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
@AmericanAir Kudos to the captain and crew for handling fustrated people while dealing with the preventable issues and shortcomings by maint
@AmericanAir do you offer group pricing discounts by any chance?
@AmericanAir now I understand!!

"@AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can't help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh"
"@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length."
@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
@AmericanAir fly my child
@AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
@AmericanAir Oh they seem  to have reappeared now lol
@AmericanAir and then wanted to change it to BA for Avios.
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."
@AmericanAir Thanks for the quick response - it's appreciated!
"@AmericanAir 
Thank you for responding...My laptop is in my bag and I need it for work. I am worried. The file code is UTEVGW."
@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
@AmericanAir thanks for the update
@AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman
@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
"Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength “@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?”"

@AmericanAir forgot to select my ksml on my flight to LA and it's a few minutes under the 24 hour mark. Is there any way to change it?
@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should’ve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
@AmericanAir Your response has been incredible. Truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. Big thank you 😄
@AmericanAir I'll DM you.
"@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths"
@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
"@AmericanAir I can DM it to you, if you follow me"
"@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home."
"@AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we’re told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don’t."

"@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago."
"@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service."
@AmericanAir does it show that we are on the same plane?
"@AmericanAir although you have no control of the weather, you came through with a great customer service"
@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.

@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. how frequently are these weather advisories updated throughout the day?
@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
"@AmericanAir thank you AA, this is how I always start my vacations http://t.co/dzKc3auZU9"
"@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?"
@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
"@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!"
"@AmericanAir Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation!"
@AmericanAir my flight number is 3M 50
@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.

@AmericanAir I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@AmericanAir thank you for replying. Trying to figure out how to get from there from DFW
@AmericanAir don't merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee

@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
@AmericanAir Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive.
@AmericanAir flight BA1551 departing tomorrow (wednesday) - not Cancelled Flightled but how can anyone make it to the airport in this weather?

@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
"@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff."

"Thank you, @AmericanAir! Much appreciated."
"I'd like the 11c I originally tried for @AmericanAir - again, happy to pay the difference"
@AmericanAir when will you be issuing a weather advisory for RDU?? the entire state of NC has shut down from the overnight winter storm.
@AmericanAir I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
"@AmericanAir mission accomplished today, Thank you!"
@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
@AmericanAir when will the merging of miles between you and @USAirways be complete? Wasn't it this month?
@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
"@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!"
@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
"@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."
"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."
"@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU"
"@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still ""Now Boarding""..."

@AmericanAir great job TYR ground crew...now let's get this bird outta here!!!  Tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes!
@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
@americanair One question.. my wife didn't get the bonus. Should I call about it today?
"@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."
@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
"@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that"
@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
"@AmericanAir was hoping for 8A if possible, for some frozen views along the way!"
@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.

@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.

@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke

@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
"@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?"
@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?
"@AmericanAir  TPA - ORD!!! AA1679 Another successful journey, thanks for the hospitality!"
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
"@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!"
@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
@AmericanAir any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago?
"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@AmericanAir Did the policy change? I've seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
"@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry"
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@AmericanAir my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help
@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir is that the flight for tomorrow?
"“@AmericanAir: @TheCandaceSmith Thanks for the shout-out, Candace! Enjoy the ride.” Always! I adore American Airlines!"
"Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."""
"Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come"
@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
@AmericanAir im still on hold...
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
@AmericanAir Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am?
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@AmericanAir @contactcej thanks!
"@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL."
"@AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort.."
@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
@AmericanAir can I send you my trusted traveler ID to add to my reservation for tsa pre?
"@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????"
@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
@AmericanAir He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?
@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
"@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed."
@AmericanAir congrats on your call center customer service! A guy named Fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! 👌👌👌
"@AmericanAir daughter record loc. is KYBILC. She is traveling with 3 y.o. and needs to be in adjacent seats, not across isle."
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
"@AmericanAir I didn't want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530"
@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
"@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
"@AmericanAir @maryella_green despite the inconvenience, the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!"
@AmericanAir Absolutely!
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?
@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
"@AmericanAir @maryella_green just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
@AmericanAir are flights from Pensacola fl delayed flight 3670
@AmericanAir the status on my itinerary says on request in red. What's that mean?
@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.
@AmericanAir @jokerunning this happened to me too!!!
@AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call
@AmericanAir thanks 😩. idk if it still Late Flight but I hope I get it tonight 😭
@AmericanAir I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
@AmericanAir u didn't give an answer why the flight delayed so long. and how do u compensate missing my other flights Lima to Cuzco??
@AmericanAir can you help me update a birthday that was incorrectly input in a reservation? This is preventing me from checking in
@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
"@AmericanAir now I have to wait ""more than 60 minutes"""
"@AmericanAir thanks, me too"

@AmericanAir everything for sorted out. Thanks for the help. Excited to get home tonight!

"@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can't get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please?"

@AmericanAir you're airline is ridiculous

"@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes"
@AmericanAir overbooked business class from Mia to uvf - after being in the correct seat we were moved back to economy on our special day
@AmericanAir no kidding! Gonna take some beating on the apron... And there are some good lookin' planes out there!
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral

"@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service."
@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days

@AmericanAir No snow in St. Louis. Cold but no snow. Hub flights welcome.
@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
"@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week."
"@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?"
@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
@AmericanAir I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.

"@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each."
@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
"@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it."
@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
@AmericanAir basically u right now http://t.co/IN24Bpb7dw
"@AmericanAir #epicfail on connections in #Chicago today, extremely disappointed w/ unaccommodating customer service, rethinking loyalty 😐"

@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
"@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning."

@AmericanAir No worries at all. Y’all have a good one!!
"@AmericanAir Yes, thanks I found those, didn't see the gray tab at first :)"
@AmericanAir but seriously if my cats dead I'm going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul
"@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!"
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
"@AmericanAir My chariot tonight. From this angle it looks like a 787, no? http://t.co/3ZZKQWWbJz"
@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after
@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!

@AmericanAir I've tried...its @USAirways anyway
"@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
@AmericanAir Flight Get Me Out Of Chicago.
@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
@AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left!
@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
"@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!"
@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
@AmericanAir See photo of B787 scale model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/kfD4WQRkLW

"@AmericanAir thanks, I'll look forward to the response."
@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
@AmericanAir yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
@AmericanAir about when can I see a new American Airlines credit card to replace my USAIRWAYS dividend MasterCard?

@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
@AmericanAir What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.

"@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!"
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
"@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant"
@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
"@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!"
@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
@AmericanAir thank you for the assistance
"@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?"
@AmericanAir need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can't travel http://t.co/gVgKHbx1RB
"@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim"
@AmericanAir hi there flight from Dallas just Cancelled Flightled going to LA. Can u pls help rebook me?
@AmericanAir 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn't said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir Thanks for doing that but now it's telling me to go to the airport and check in with an agent-what's up? http://t.co/PfseNJk5Pw
@AmericanAir what's the best number to use?
@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
@AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice?
"@AmericanAir Chicago seen from seat 6A, AA 1620. So far a great ride! On to PDX! http://t.co/X4rsvAGIjN"
@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?
"@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r"
@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
@AmericanAir I had booked online but unable to Cancelled Flight online. But finally got thru.
@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
"@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
"@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work."
"@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!"
"@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call."
@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
"@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!"
"@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour."
@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice"
@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! 👍👍👍👍👍
"@AmericanAir Uhmmm we need @JColeNC down in Dallas,Tx for his tour 😫😫😫"
@AmericanAir is there a way to reserve my dog’s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline!
@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
"@americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD"
@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
"@AmericanAir Thanks for asking On second plane after maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. Sitting at gate in very very warm plane"
"@AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the ""flyers right's booklet"""
@AmericanAir please dm me
@AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can't be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday.
"@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag"
@AmericanAir great job and great service in and out of SDF this weekend during the winter storm.
@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
"@AmericanAir but don't you worry... @Delta took good care of me... Your loss, their gain."
@AmericanAir welcome anyone who works in those conditions deserves a thank you even though I am other side of #Atlantic lol xx
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SWU (typo in last post) space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
"@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?"
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
@AmericanAir yes I have. Thanks
@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
@AmericanAir i got a new reservation for tomorrow. Thanks!
"@AmericanAir I have a couple questions for you, if you’re available for PM?"
@AmericanAir Is my friends flight 386 from JAX to DFW Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
"@AmericanAir $90 dollar RT ticket to Chicago? Yes, Please!"
@AmericanAir Thank you
@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
@AmericanAir not helpful
"@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt"
"@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't."
@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
@AmericanAir well you spelled my name wrong.
"@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold"
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
"@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM"
@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.
@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl
@AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn't able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line.
@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
"@AmericanAir ""bag has not yet been located"". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?"
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@AmericanAir @maxfitgirl29 next time fly Southwest...
@AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck.
@AmericanAir Kudos to the crew of Flt 167 today. Specially to Carlton. Loved your new 767-300. Keep up the good work AA!
@AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
"@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox."
@AmericanAir get me outta here
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up…
@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
"@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight."
@AmericanAir All of the nicest people in the world work at Admiral's clubs. Gladys in San Juan es mi Amiga
@AmericanAir due to road conditions
@AmericanAir I was going to change it to tomorrow because I am concerned if the fllight does make I won't be able to leave the airport   1/2
"@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!"
"@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport"
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
"@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day."
@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir well Done all of you xx
"@AmericanAir Thanks. Having issues checking in for flight, please check our DM convo for more info."
@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"
@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
@AmericanAir My father loved working for you as well as PanAm
@AmericanAir 249 EWR - DFW is now stopping BNA to refuel 4 bad weather? Are YOU just trying to get the plane closer 2 DFW then Cancelled Flight on us?
"@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available."
@AmericanAir now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
@AmericanAir  CXL flight. rebooked 2 PAX no problems. Thank you and everyone at AA for helping us all out!
@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.
@AmericanAir I wrote down the evoucher number. I got rid of the voucher when I purchased air fair
@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true

"@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was ""no longer available"" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC"
@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
@AmericanAir can you?
@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
"@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable"
@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?

@AmericanAir I did set up notifications through AA &amp; Us airways. still nothing
@AmericanAir how can I get travel question answered quickly... Online and calling not helping with this busy day
"@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: ""can I have some water?"" ""no we don't do that. please take your seat"""
"@AmericanAir The website won't let me view my reservation due to ""changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY"". I'm on hold now to get help."

@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
"@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch"
@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
"@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire"
@AmericanAir  thanks hoping that by wed I can get back to DFW

@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
@AmericanAir BRING MY FIANCÉ @meerikangas BACK TO ME!
@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable 😐
@AmericanAir are you anticipating weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightations for afternoon departures out of AUS today?
@AmericanAir No worries. Don't blame you for weather.
@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!
"@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted"
@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
"@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"
@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
"@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent."
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
@AmericanAir I need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow
@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @FlyHighAirways all the way!
@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
"@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can"""
@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
@AmericanAir - trying to track down backs for two of my attendees #help
@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
"@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice"
@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?
@AmericanAir thanks for responding ... will do!
"@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology"
@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
@AmericanAir I just sent a DM
@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
"@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.
Direct email?"
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ✈️ brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
"@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love..."
@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
"@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye""."
@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.
"@AmericanAir I hear #Delta is offering 2,500 miles to frequent flyers if their bags doesn't come out within 20 minutes of landing thoughts?"
@AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up.

"@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet."
"@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!"
@AmericanAir in miami and the  agents Rachel Wong and Marisol Pimentel were very  pleasant in a world of chaos a BIG .thank u
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off

"@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked."
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."
@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
@AmericanAir do you know if there is wifi on this flight? If so how much is it? Thank you :-)
@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!
@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@AmericanAir Will 2396 be Cancelled Flightled tonight?
"@AmericanAir Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst"
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
@AmericanAir cannot provide us alternative flight until 36 hours Late Flightr ruining our trip! #Cancelled Flightled #angry #problems #ruined.
@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
"@AmericanAir I love travel with yours planes, all people is very nice, it's amazing! Can you please follow me back? 😋I love the company!"
@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic ."

@AmericanAir is DFW accepting any arrivals or departures today?
"@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?"
@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back

"@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool"

.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.

"@AmericanAir you bet make this screw up right (for once). Things I need in bag for my job and you have ""grounded"" me today #painandsuffering"
"@AmericanAir Last thing I want to deal w/ before 8 on a Mon! I've already waited the suggested wait time, so I hope I get a call back ASAP."
@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.
@AmericanAir @emrey35 But it says your agents are too busy and to try back Late Flightr???
"@AmericanAir file loc:TJYCQH. Bag at airport since last nite.Not ""scheduled"" to get PU unt aft 8? WHY? U shld b ashamed. I'm disgusted w/u"
@AmericanAir I remained on hold for 2 hrs to resolve my flight schedule &amp; your system hung up on me. #unhappycustomer
@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.
@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
"@AmericanAir 3days and no call,bag or anyone to pick up my call. Held on ph til 130 am and holding again now. Insane,#help"
"@AmericanAir way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back"
"@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?"
@AmericanAir thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
@AmericanAir thank you!
@AmericanAir I Love American Airlines :D
"@AmericanAir how about a reservation phone system that actually works? You know the 800 number is unreachable? Callbacks are ""dead air""."
"@AmericanAir , I was told my flights 2516 &amp; 2244 was Cancelled Flightled. But I don't seem to have any date/time changes. I've been waiting for a call"
@AmericanAir v nice of you to give me a breakfast voucher for $7 in an airport. That almost got me a whole drink!!
"@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?"
@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
@AmericanAir you're running 5+ hours behind replying to anyone via Twitter. this is beyond unacceptable. I'm running out of time!

@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
"@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday."
@AmericanAir thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff
@AmericanAir thinks it's a good cs to get everyone through the gate for flight 4275 then we wait bc plane not ready http://t.co/rxmjWoo7Qi

"@AmericanAir Hey, what's happening with #AA65 Zurich - JFK? Appears to have squawked 7700 and landed at London Heathrow"
@AmericanAir got call saying flight Cancelled Flightled but checked online and it isn't Cancelled Flightled. No where near bad weather. I have job interview
"@AmericanAir Hello ! I cannot register for my tomorrow flight from Paris to Las Vegas ""This feature is currently unavailable"" appears ?"
@AmericanAir When did they start to sell water @AdmiralsClub ?
@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
"@AmericanAir Hi guys, can you tell me what the emergency is for #AA65 diverting to #Heathrow from Zurich-New York? Thanks, John."
@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
@AmericanAir a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
"@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever."
@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather✈️
@AmericanAir you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
"@AmericanAir Thanks guys, you got it. I'm heading to Milan on Wednesday, so big week with the AA family :)"
@AmericanAir 953 our  fligth Somthing to talk  about this?
@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy

@AmericanAir No I do not have them yet. Called for baggage status 5 times yesterday.
@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.
@AmericanAir @USAirways wonderful FC FA on flight 2062 pre dawn!  Nice start to the day!
@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
"@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help."
"@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been ""reticketed"" on."
"@AmericanAir @loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried."
@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
"@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to"
@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me 😭
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
"@AmericanAir we have been rebooked due to weather, but need to change our reservation and fly on the 24th, instead of the 23rd."
@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.

@AmericanAir what terminal LHR for aa5/BA1506? Doesn't say in boarding pass
@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
"@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call"

@AmericanAir Hi. I have KOA-LAX-PHL-ORD booked as a 1-way savr awrd. If I called to chnge it to KOA-LAX-PHX-ORD would I have to pay any fees
@AmericanAir been calling 2 different offices already and still no sign of my baggage. First time on American Air.. (6)
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
"@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks"
@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
@AmericanAir me because it might not be so urgent for you but it really is for me. (5)
@AmericanAir i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)
"@AmericanAir flight 45 JFK-LAS. First the catering was Late Flight, the. No push back crew. 2hrs delay."
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
"@AmericanAir my two coats were in that bag so i have been in france with no coat, walking around with a T shirt and one clean pair.(3)"
@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
"@AmericanAir So i was visiting SJU and was returning to Paris and they checked my bag at the gate in SJU, i arrived in paris and nothing,(1)"

@AmericanAir can you use the aa credit platinum select world mastercard for Alaska flights?  Or just american?
@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
"@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that..."
@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
"@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!"
@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset

@AmericanAir working over time tonight?  Got delayed 2 days .. In SJU .. Could be worse :)

@AmericanAir I'm in MEX.  I need to fly to New York City tomorrow. My new flight on Tuesday is unacceptable. Please help.
@AmericanAir my mom’s flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted w/ no notice. Phone system said callback in 2 hours and it’s been 4. I need to go to bed!
@AmericanAir I'm trying to reach the advantage department to add my number to a recent flight
@AmericanAir I am going to keep these tweets coming till AA does something...which I know is nothing..hoping I go way...not likely.
@AmericanAir make sure u insure your luggage as those assholes @ AA take no fricken responsibility...&amp; don't  believe their lies!!!!
@AmericanAir-everyone: its been weeks&amp;those dickheads @ AA hadn't contacted me...they lost my checked bag &amp; carryon and haven't offer to pay
@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
@AmericanAir 235.  We made it to Seattle...
@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
"@AmericanAir To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately."
"@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2"
"@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!"
@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
"@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?"
@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
"@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your ""customer service"" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS"
@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying

@AmericanAir  MY FLIGHT #2962 OUT OF CLL @ 0600 WON'T LET ME CHECK IN. PLEASE HELP. #IMPORTANTFLIGHT
@AmericanAir Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
"@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours."
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?"
"@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service"
@AmericanAir Flight 4606 from MEM to DCA delayed 6 hours! Now holding breath while they keep me trapped 3 hours to de-ice. #scareair
@AmericanAir stuck in airplane both on way out of PHL and again in Houston. All passengers frustrated. Makes me want to avoid airline
"@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website"
"@AmericanAir flight from PHL to Austin Cancelled Flighted, headed to Houston, delayed, now have to pay to rent a car and drive 3 hrs to Austin"
"@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight."

@AmericanAir @Nashinmypants lmao this is so funny
@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in
@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
@AmericanAir I left something on my flight from ORD to SFO earlier today and believe it's on the plane back at ORD now. Please help.
"@AmericanAir How is hanging up on customers because of ""high volume"" customer service? Tried to resolve via DM-still waiting.So bad. #aafail"
"@AmericanAir  I was told it would be emailed to me, but I haven't received anything yet. How can I follow-up?"
@AmericanAir all good! I'm catching the 11:10p flight tonight. Thanks for the response.
"@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly, another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on."
"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company."
@AmericanAir booked AA3370 departing JFK 2/25/15. It was booked via BA and I want to change my FF# to AA can you do that for me via Twitter?
@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
"@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations."
@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
@AmericanAir Joanna did a WONDERFUL job!  Thank her for me?
@AmericanAir She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we’ve relatives nearby.
@AmericanAir first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
@AmericanAir Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp; asks for her to contact you at 800 number.
@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
@AmericanAir Toby hates you lol
@AmericanAir Thanx for replying. DM sent
@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
@AmericanAir not anymore.
"@AmericanAir Need to change flight, but the CS # is telling me it can't take my call. Can't change online. Please help. Flight is this week."
@AmericanAir 48 hours and still no bag. Could have flown to Costa Rica and back by now. I had gifts for my family in my bags.
"@AmericanAir No, when I call AA now I can't even get on hold...can you help me?"
"@AmericanAir lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia"

"@AmericanAir Thank you for holding, we apologize for the delay in answering your call. To speak to a representative please continue to hold."
@AmericanAir Weather was not involved.
"@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd..."
@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
"@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?"
"@AmericanAir our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc"
"@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful."
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
"@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking."
@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!
"@AmericanAir Joanna is wonderful, new flight booked by a very friendly and helpful agent during a very stressful day! Thank You!"
@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
@AmericanAir thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?
@AmericanAir ok no worries. Thanks for the straight story. It's appreciated.
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response.  When I book I've tried my AA number and my US Airways number and each time it doesn't pick it up
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝
@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
"@AmericanAir You should really help @Cowboycerrone out, you are getting a TON of bad publicity right now #WillNeverFlyWithYou"
@AmericanAir flight number #2386
@AmericanAir it looks like a mistake

"@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta"

"@AmericanAir today, after 6 yrs., no longer my preferred airline."
"@AmericanAir Thanks. Two hours to go inflight, then hotel.  Hang in there with all the DFW travel delays AA team."
"@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful."
"@AmericanAir next time my flight's Cancelled Flightled, I'd appreciate SOME indication (email, text, carrier pigeon). App didn't even warn at check in"

@AmericanAir online flight notification is down.

"@AmericanAir I paid extra $ for my seat &amp; the monitor didn't work from on AA111. How about a refund on the seat? Conf #: MDBEEI, McMullen"
@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
"@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?"
@AmericanAir any luck?
@AmericanAir Group Cancelled Flights close to a thousand #flights Monday http://t.co/v1RADYKEP2
@AmericanAir it's been almost 3 days and it's still frozen. Thanks doll 😘😑

@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
"@AmericanAir looking for status of flight 1388 schedule for 5:15 am tomorrow morning, thank you"
@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
"@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if I’m logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 😥."
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone  ratchet airway!. ......

@AmericanAir My flight tomorrow from SLC to DFW AA304 Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me get there?

@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
@AmericanAir anything you can do?
"@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!"
@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
@AmericanAir My ex-boyfriend picks up my calls more than you do! #Cancelled Flightedflight #nocustomerservice #americanairlines #FAIL
"@AmericanAir Hey AA, a suggestion: Note on your seat maps what seats have electronics box blocking legroom. AA215 http://t.co/hcNN0wXQQr"
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@AmericanAir Didn't really need anything. Saw your mentions are often negative. Keep up the good work. #gratitude  🇺🇸✈️
@AmericanAir #AmericanView Sweet Home Chicago http://t.co/J6icLV8DTs
"@AmericanAir LTALJX, from DCA to OMA this morning. All of the staff that helped me fix my problem were so helpful. #goodthingscome #thanks"
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
"@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they ""couldn't staff the plane"""
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
"@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove 
#whybeAAFF?"
"@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours."
@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
"@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer"
"@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral."
"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
"@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad."
@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
"@AmericanAir Yes, thanks for checking. Very cramped, but got on &amp; made it safely. Flying back tomorrow at 1pm. http://t.co/CSddCCMvbD"
@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
"@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online."
@AmericanAir what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
"@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard ""your bag has not been located."" 😩"
@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
"@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?"
@AmericanAir Need to go frm TPA to MCI tmrw &amp; my connection thru DFW is Cancelled Flightled. Can u connect me thru a diff city? Been on hold for 2 hrs
@americanair Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing.
@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
"“@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.” Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!"
@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
"@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service"
"@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
"@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding."
@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43
"@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early"
"@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
@AmericanAir can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already?
@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
@AmericanAir pathetic service
@AmericanAir Dallas/Fort Worth flight number 5320
"@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!"
@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
@AmericanAir yes. He's in the next flight
@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though
"@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please"
@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
"@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!"
@AmericanAir Still looking as we speak.
"@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!"
@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation
"@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!"
@AmericanAir thanks to Marie for reFlight Booking Problems me and my friends!!! I'm Cali bound thanks to this sweet angel! #blessed
@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
"@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags"
@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
@AmericanAir its Adolfo Garcia
"@AmericanAir My friend needs some help on her flt (she's not on Twiiter), can I DM you her info?"
"@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"
@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@AmericanAir I know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @AUStinAirport
@AmericanAir And gold status too.
@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."
Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines"
@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
@AmericanAir American Airlines.
@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
@AmericanAir I just DMed you
@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳"
"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
"@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I'm really mad about the situation"
"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"
"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."

@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
"@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!"
@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA

@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
@AmericanAir thanks for the show! 👍
"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
"@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA."
"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
"@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z"
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡
@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
@AmericanAir @cyncyn661 Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !!
@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
"@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier"
"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
@AmericanAir Close down
@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number
@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
"@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying ""standby"""
@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
"@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w"
@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos
@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
"@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed"
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
"@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?"
@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
@AmericanAir What's the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday?
@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ❤❤
@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a
"@AmericanAir Hey, so... I think I left my wallet on you. Can I have it back, please?"
"@AmericanAir ok, thanks you! Have a great night AA team!"
@AmericanAir - Can you please give me a travel agent support phone number? I cant find it on your website. Thanks.
@AmericanAir any idea what's up with flight AA3181?
@AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@AmericanAir sucks!! Teco teco #reclameaqui #TripAdvisor http://t.co/auGJsCmoLu
@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst
@AmericanAir 24 hours on the AirPort
@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.
"@AmericanAir plane breaks, unloads the passengers, told to re enter to only come back off. Flight Cancelled Flightled, missed wedding. #badbusiness"
@AmericanAir - very upset with my hometown airline. Stuck in Den Flt Cancelled Flightled. Others here with me got new Flt info

"@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child."
@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
@AmericanAir Trip cut 7 hrs short due to flight change/massive layovers/ no peanuts or crackers/ asked for H2O and received about 2oz.
@AmericanAir Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
@AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒
@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
"@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him ""I understand English."" His reply?""Our conversation is over."""
"@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better"
@AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc
@AmericanAir is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?
"@AmericanAir Do you happen to know if that plane will be repainted, or fly ""off into the sunset?"""
@AmericanAir - AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?

"@AmericanAir I've got a BA flight as your airport couldn't accommodate us. We were left without any info. No vouchers for food,nothing."

@AmericanAir many trips coming up!  I will see you soon 😃
@AmericanAir message and pics sent...
@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?
@AmericanAir … Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
@AmericanAir Considering it was purchased on the 21st and I attempted to use it again on the 21st I believe it would fit these parameters.
"@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection."
@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF
"@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines."

@AmericanAir I'm great thanks keep up the good work
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.
@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
@AmericanAir @dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow. Iceday?
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
"@AmericanAir yes, I will do just that as soon as I have a moment to gather my thoughts."
@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
@AmericanAir Just learned my flight is Cancelled Flightled.can't get through by phone and don't see any option for assistance online. Any suggestions?

@AmericanAir ...is this how you want to treat your platinum (and two gold) flyers??
@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
"@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info...."
"@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers."

@AmericanAir what name and department does it come under? Thanks
@AmericanAir 1416 Cancelled Flightled? Can't get out for two days? No explanation?
"@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication."

#nothelpful MT @AmericanAir: Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance.
"@AmericanAir I've been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through?"

@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight previous request. Will accept ticket number for document number
@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
@AmericanAir 62 inches !?
@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights
@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!

"@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks."
"@AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!"
@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
"“@AmericanAir: @Dawn_Davis You're very welcome, Dawn. We love taking you flying. Let's do it again!” Again in 1 week!"
@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure
"@AmericanAir one of my luggage didn't made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told 😓😭"
"@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there."
@AmericanAir check your dm pls
@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :)
@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
@AmericanAir a guy try right...
@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.

@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
"As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :("
@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
@AmericanAir My flt AA375 for 02/23 got cncled and i cant get hold of a CSR so i can get alternate arrangement. Plz help
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed

"@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up."
"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one
@AmericanAir 1138 got us to LGA safely. Thanks for taking the time to make the plane safe before flying!
"@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail."
"@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An ""aw, let me help"" cld mk it btr"
"@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way."
@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ✈ :-)
@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
"@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u."
@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
@AmericanAir five times at last count
@AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded
@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(
"@AmericanAir Orbitz has only shown ""priority"" seats since we booked &amp; paid 3 weeks ago."
"@AmericanAir has Cancelled Flighted their last 3 flight into SHV tonight &amp; all flights for tomorrow, Feb. 23, out of SHV and multiple flight into SHV."
@AmericanAir this might look good but the pita is inedible. Last year delicious shrimp cocktail. This year garbage http://t.co/Sotl8XQsrp
@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer
"@AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP!"
"@AmericanAir not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet..."
@AmericanAir flights have been on time Late Flightly though!
@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?
"@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait ""over 2 hours"" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?"
@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
@AmericanAir u cant spell airline and I trusted you to get me home on time and safe you are the worst #gobankrupt http://t.co/aM9CuieWO4

".@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover."
"@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves."
@AmericanAir RDU Customer Service is awesome. Thanks! Give em all bonuses.
@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal

@AmericanAir now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
"@AmericanAir after all, the plane didn’t land in identical or worse) conditions at GRK according to METARs."
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank

@AmericanAir I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don't want to honor my flight.
@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
@americanair Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail
@AmericanAir hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
@AmericanAir since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport?

@AmericanAir On flt 1627 from DFW to FAT on 2/23 and it was 86'd. Can you rebook me on the 1359 flight tonight? Can't get through on phone.
@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
"@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am"
@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
"@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times."
"@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind."
@AmericanAir my return flight is scheduled on Wednesday; AA138 I believe.  Thanks for the help!
@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
"@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your ""team"" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting."

@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."

@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir yes and I would like a refund.

@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
"@AmericanAir guarantee no retribution? If so, I'd be glad to share."
